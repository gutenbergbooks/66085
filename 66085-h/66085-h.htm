<br />&ldquo;GIVE US YOUR HAND ON THAT.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Young Harry Northend remained by his lonely camp-fire
in the wilderness, long after the dull, dismal day had dawned,
in the hope that Little Rifle, his promised bride of the wilderness,
as he loved to look upon her, would return.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Now and then he ventured to call to her, although he well
knew the risk he incurred in doing so; for he had learned
by his previous experience that the dreaded Blackfeet Indians
were to be expected at any time, when beyond gun-shot of
the fort.</p>
<p>The snow had stopped falling, but it lay to the depth of
several inches upon the ground, and seemed to have extended
over a wide area of country. He walked round and round
the camp several times, searching for the imprint of her delicate
moccasin; but the keenest search he could make failed
to reveal the slightest trace of her footsteps.</p>
<p>This proved, that whatever might be the cause of her disappearance,
it had operated before the fall of the snow&mdash;so
that, at the least, she had already been absent several hours.</p>
<p>But whither had she gone? What was the cause of her
disappearing so suddenly? Had she departed alone and unattended,
or was some one else concerned in it?</p>
<p>These were questions which, without exaggeration, it is
safe to say, the lad asked himself a hundred times, and which
still remained unanswered.</p>
<p>There was but one conjecture that he could make, which
seemed to bear the least shadow of reason, and that was that
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
she had voluntarily returned to the lodge of her guardian and
friend, old Ruff Robsart, the old mountaineer and hunter&mdash;not
with the intention of remaining there, but with the purpose
of consulting with him before taking the all-important step
which she had decided to take, in leaving that Oregon wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no great distance there,&rdquo; he mused, as he turned this
thought over in his mind, &ldquo;and seeing me asleep in the early
part of the evening, she may have thought she could go and
return before I would awake; for she can traverse these woods
as well in the dark as in the daytime, and she might easily
have made such a journey, but I suppose old Robsart has kept
her, and I must go there after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Settling down to this conclusion, he decided first to go on
to the fort, as he could make the distance in a few hours. He
had been absent several days, and his return would set at rest
any uneasiness that his friends might feel, and possibly avert
the awkward consequences of a search for him by several of
the hunters at the post.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when he had made up his mind that it was
useless to wait any longer by the camp-fire, he slung his rifle
over his shoulder, and started at a brisk walk for his headquarters
at Fort Abercrombie, which was safely reached within
a couple of hours after.</p>
<p>He found every thing here as when he had left, a few days
before, and after partaking of breakfast, and remaining a short
time, he started on his return to the lodge of Old Ruff, on the
Columbia river, below. On the route, he visited the scene of
their encampment in the ravine, the night before, thinking it
barely possible that Little Rifle had visited it during her absence,
but there were no indications of her having done so,
and he resumed his walk in an eastward direction.</p>
<p>Harry set great value by his field telescope, which he constantly
bore with him, and whenever he reached a point a
little more elevated than usual, he acted like a General who
was reconnoitering a hostile territory&mdash;making as careful a
survey as was possible, in the limited time which his impatience
would permit him to use.</p>
<p>Scarcely once did the glass fail to show him the presence
of Indians. They seemed to be here, there and everywhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
in this part of Oregon, and the adjoining territory of Washington.
Indeed, more than once he paused and scrutinized
more closely his immediate surroundings, for it seemed that
there must be more still nearer him; but happily he seemed
to be free from that danger, and he took care to conceal his
trail as much as possible, by using rocks and flinty surfaces,
wherever he could turn them to account.</p>
<p>In this fashion he finally reached a ridge, upon which Little
Rifle had slain an antelope, on the preceding day. Here
he made another survey of the territory, in every direction,
wondering all the time whether any of the numerous &ldquo;signs&rdquo;
which he encountered indicated the presence of Little Rifle;
for despite the theory into which he had settled, he could not
free himself of the doubt that, after all, he might have failed
in his supposition.</p>
<p>This naturally increased his eagerness to hurry forward,
and end the suspense as soon as possible; and so, lingering
but a short time upon the ridge, he descended the eastern
slope, and carefully following the route taken the morning
before, being compelled on his way to ford several streams,
he succeeded in reaching his destination at last.</p>
<p>It was very near the hour of noon when he did so, and the
mild warm sun had completely dissipated the snow that had
fallen the previous night. Here and there the leaves were
wet, and on the shady side of a rock he occasionally detected
a white tuft of the cold feathery snow, but it may be said,
that if unaware of the fact, no one would have believed what
a fierce flurry had occurred but a few hours before.</p>
<p>As Harry entered the ravine, in which the odd, fantastic
home of old Robsart was located, while gathering peltries, he
found his heart beating violently and his face flushing, as is
the case when one walks forward to hear his doom pronounced
by the stern and inflexible judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she has not returned,&rdquo; he repeated to himself,
&ldquo;what will he say? What will he do? What will I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the little compact dwelling-house&mdash;if
such it may be termed&mdash;was in sight, and before the entrance
he saw the old mountaineer, engaged in cleaning the skins of
several animals, preparatory to stretching them out on sticks
in the sun to prepare them for packing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He merely glanced up as he heard him coming, and then,
without speaking or making any salutation, continued his
work. Harry advanced resolutely forward, and, determined to
know the worst at once, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Uncle Ruff. Has Little Rifle returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper, seemingly suspecting that something was
wrong, suddenly started and looked up with a sharp, inquiring
glance. Next moment came his answer, too clear and
direct for any mistake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t sot eyes on him sense you and him went away yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Heaven only knows what has become of <i>her</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
Harry, in the very wretchedness of despair, as he sat
down upon a log and covered his face with his hands. &ldquo;She
went away in the night, and I can not tell why it was she left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp-eared trapper noticed the peculiar way in which
the lad referred to Little Rifle, and, ceasing his work and
walking to where he was seated, he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, younker, by calling Little Rifle <i>her</i>?
What are yer thinking &rsquo;bout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had not been the intention of Harry Northend to reveal
the revelations of last night in this fashion; indeed he had
not settled in his mind that he was going to reveal it at all;
but now, as he had given the all-important hint in his ill-guarded
speech, there was nothing left for him to do except
to make a clean breast of it.</p>
<p>And this was done. He told the story from beginning to
end, even to the declaration of love that he had made to Little
Rifle, and her partial confession of the same; he referred
particularly to her tender regard for Uncle Ruff, and her determination
to consult him before leaving the wilderness for
a civilized life, which declaration caused him to believe that
she had absented herself for that purpose. He related, too,
their conversation and plans regarding the future, especially
the project he had framed of her being taken in charge by
his father and educated.</p>
<p>Harry saw from the first that Robsart was to be the main
character in rescuing Little Rifle; that scarcely any thing
could be done without his assistance, and so he told the
whole truth, keeping back nothing that came into his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>And it was a wise thing upon his part. Old Ruff had
liked the lad from the first, and his rather annoying <i>surveillance</i>
of him during the preceding day was merely an attempt
to satisfy himself as to whether the lad suspected any thing
of the secret of the sex of his <i>protege</i>. Such was his course
toward any one who was accidentally thrown into their
company, and his greater regard for his charge, naturally
made him willing to see any one depart after he had spent a
little time with them.</p>
<p>But what a tale was it that the lad told him! Here was
a clew, or a partial one, to the very mystery which he had
vainly sought to unravel for a dozen years.</p>
<p>He had learned her true name&mdash;the name of her father&mdash;the
fact that she had no mother living, and the name of the
chief in whose charge she had been placed, and that a few
years ago would have been sufficient for him to have learned
all, for he knew her earliest protector, Maquesa, the Blackfoot,
very well, and had encountered him more than once,
without suspecting that he ever had any thing to do with
the little waif, which was taken from a lodge far up in the
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Uncle Ruff,&rdquo; said Harry, after he had completed
the narration, &ldquo;I have told you every thing I know, and I
have come to you for help. How do you feel about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old, hairy-faced bear-tamer stretched out his broad,
horny palm and grasped that of the lad with a warm and almost
crushing grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked you the fust time I seen you, and you&rsquo;ve come to
me in such a squar&rsquo; fashion that I like you more than ever&mdash;so
give us your hand on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows what has become of Little Rifle&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t; but we do know that she is somewhar above ground,
and you and me are going to diskiver her&mdash;so give us your
hand on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling my head fur the last six months to try
and lay out some course to take with that little pet of mine
but it was mighty hard to fix on any thing. As I see&rsquo;d her
growing up without civilized ways, I felt I warn&rsquo;t doing
right, but I kept putting things off, &rsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t know what
I orter to do. Of course it war my place to take her into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
settlements somewhar and give her a fair start: <i>that</i> I could see
plain enough, but the trouble war that I hadn&rsquo;t any of the sort of
acquaintances that I wanted to put her among. You can see
she&rsquo;s purty, and she&rsquo;s getting purtier every week, and the
fear that haunted me was that if I took her down to Fr&rsquo;isco
or Sacramento, or some of them other places, she might be
ruined, and I&rsquo;d rather keep her here till she died, than to
feel that I&rsquo;d had any thing to do in bringing about that sort
of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the plan that you&rsquo;ve got up, in that smart head of
yours, is jist the thing, and Providence put it there! Nothin&rsquo;
on airth could have pleased me more; if the little pet war
only here I&rsquo;d give a war-whoop and dance. We&rsquo;re going
to set out to find her, and we&rsquo;re going to find her, and when
she&rsquo;s found she&rsquo;s going East with you and your father, and
when you both get old enough she&rsquo;s going to be your wife,
and I&rsquo;m going to be your grandmother&mdash;no your grandaddy I
mean&mdash;so give us your hand on it ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />DOUBT AND PERPLEXITY.</h2>
<p>Thus the compact was sealed, and Harry Northend already
felt a renewal of hope at this hearty manifestation of confidence
in him by the man who was to be the all-important
auxiliary in the work of searching out his lost bride of the
wilderness.</p>
<p>But he was naturally desirous of hearing from the experienced
trapper and mountaineer his theory to account for the
mysterious disappearance of Little Rifle, as they both preferred
to call her in preference to the new and correct name of
Hagar. As yet he had offered no conjecture, and indeed so
far as Harry could perceive had not even given it a thought.
He now ventured to ask the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It was the &rsquo;arthquake!</i>&rdquo; was the astounding reply.</p>
<p>But for the seriousness of the occasion, and the perfect solemness
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the bear-tamer&rsquo;s manner, Harry would have taken
this as a specimen of his waggery, but it was any thing but
that, and the lad stared in blank amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what I mean?&rdquo; asked the old hunter, observing
his wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest idea,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, you know what an &rsquo;arthquake is, don&rsquo;t you? I
s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ve read about &rsquo;em, hain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have; every school-boy has read of terrible
earthquakes, but what do you mean by saying that the loss of
Little Rifle has been caused by such a thing as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you slept so healthy last night that you didn&rsquo;t
hear it, nor know nothing &rsquo;bout it; but just afore the snow
begun fallin&rsquo;, the ground shook; I felt the old lodge of mine
rock like a cradle, and I made a dive out-doors so sudden-like
that I hit my head ag&rsquo;in the log thar and split it, so it&rsquo;s almost
sp&rsquo;iled. I knowed the &rsquo;arth was off on a waltz, and
I done a little dancing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange that I knew nothing of it,&rdquo; exclaimed the
awed lad; &ldquo;I never even suspected such a thing could have
happened, although I heard them say something at the fort
about an earthquake, and I have heard it said that they have
felt a shock once or twice in California, but I hardly thought
it could be real. But how, Uncle Ruff, could that have caused
Little Rifle to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, you see it must have took something extronnery to
get her away from you and me&mdash;nothin&rsquo; else would have done
it, and I think an &rsquo;arthquake is about the most extronnery
thing that could have come&mdash;so it must have been <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can admit all that,&rdquo; returned Harry, as much perplexed
as ever, &ldquo;but still I can not see in what particular way the
earthquake caused her to desert us. You don&rsquo;t mean that it
caused her death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t believe it caused the death of <i>any</i> one, and
I don&rsquo;t know how it affected her; but here the whole thing
is: Little Rifle is gone, and it&rsquo;s a mighty strange thing&mdash;her
going. About as near as we can figure thar&rsquo;s a mighty big
&rsquo;arthquake that come along &rsquo;bout that time&mdash;so it&rsquo;s just as
plain as the nose on your face that the two are mixed.
&rsquo;Zactly how it is I don&rsquo;t pretend to say, but we&rsquo;ll go up to
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
your camping-ground and cypher round and try and find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This looked like &ldquo;business,&rdquo; and it was a great relief to
Harry, who chafed at the delay, feeling that every hour was
lessening the chances of discovering the lost one.</p>
<p>There was little cause for tardiness and the old trapper
made none. When he had finished the words just given, he
threw his long, deadly rifle over his shoulder, and moved with
sweeping strides up the ravine, Harry being obliged to keep
up a sort of dog-trot to prevent himself from falling in the
rear. As he emerged into the more open country he cast a
hasty glance around, as if in obedience to an instinctive caution;
but nothing of an alarming nature was to be seen.</p>
<p>The lad judged from the manner of old Robsart that he
was speculating in his mind as to the probable cause of the
disappearance of Little Rifle, and so he did not vex him with
questions which he knew he was unable to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know thar&rsquo;s one thing that I think is mighty
lucky?&rdquo; said the trapper, suddenly turning his head toward
the lad, and speaking as if the idea had been in his mind for
some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but I hope it is
something big, for we need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; of that &rsquo;ere glass of yourn. I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em
at the fort and down at Fr&rsquo;isco, and of course knowed what
they war used for, and yet I was always such a fool that I
never knowed enough to bring &rsquo;em &rsquo;long with me. You can
see how mighty handy a telescope would be on the perarie,
where you could tell the varmints a long time before they
could see you. Hold on to that tight, for I&rsquo;ve an idee that
it&rsquo;s going to be of some use to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is little danger of my losing it, for you
know I carried it over the falls with me, where I lost nearly
every thing except that and my life. But, Robsart, didn&rsquo;t I
hear you say that you knew this Indian chief, Maquesa, who
had charge of Little Rifle in her earlier years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the trapper, &ldquo;I knowed him several years
ago, on the other side of the Cascade Range. I never met
him on this side, and that &rsquo;ere puzzled me a little. You see
when I picked up the little pet, it was on this side the range,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
and some distance further north, and it seems that here is
whar I orter find the old rip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His tribe is on both sides, so that mystery may not be a
very deep one after all. But, how is it that he comes to be
an acquaintance of yours? Do you class him as a friendly
Indian?&rdquo; asked Harry, naturally enough deeply interested in
any matter that bore any relation to Little Rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rather qu&rsquo;ar,&rdquo; replied the grizzled old hunter, as
he recalled some reminiscence. &ldquo;I was going down one of
the forks of Willamette River, just over the mountain. I
was just then hunting bears, and didn&rsquo;t understand &rsquo;em as
well as I do now. One arternoon I spied a feller full as
big as Old Adams&rsquo; Samson. I seen him come down to the
edge of the river and start to swim across, and I put out in a
canoe to head him off. I wanted to drive him back among
the rocks on the side whar he was leavin&rsquo;, as I had a smashin&rsquo;
big trap set there, that I thought would hold him&mdash;but
the critter wouldn&rsquo;t turn, and when I got a little too close
with my boat he just give it a slap with his paw, and away
it went all to shivers, and me heels over head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much afraid of the varmint in the water, as I
knowed I could dodge him, but I was thundering mad &rsquo;cause
I lost my gun, cap and one of my moccasins, and the bear
wouldn&rsquo;t turn back for me arter all. So I had to paddle
ashore and when I got thar, with nothing but my knife, who
should I see pop out from behind the rocks but a Blackfoot.
He let drive his tomahawk, just to let me know he was coming,
and when I dodged that he came with his knife, leaving
his gun somewhar behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, you can make up your mind that thar was some
music about then. We had just the same weapons, and we
sailed in, cutting and slashin&rsquo; each other like a couple of
wild-cats. Wal, he war a little the toughest varmint I ever
got hold on. We clawed awhile, and then I knocked his
knife out of his hand, and dropped mine at the same time.
Arter that we kept it up in Yankee Sullivan style, until we
both got so tired that we couldn&rsquo;t strike a blow hard enough
to make a musketer wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, to make a long story short,&rdquo; added the old fellow,
with a grin, &ldquo;it turned out that me and Maquesa war exactly
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
even matched. I wasn&rsquo;t a ha&rsquo;r stronger than him, nor was
he a ha&rsquo;r stronger, and arter we laid back and rested and kept
it up fur three full hours, he got upon his feet and said,
&lsquo;<i>White man is too much fur Maquesa</i>,&rsquo; and offered me his
hand. That rather took me down, but I shook his paw, and
we parted. That sorter made us friends you know, and I&rsquo;ve
met the old varmint three or four times since, and he always
acts as though he thought a mighty heap of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know as the Indians ever showed such chivalry
as that,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;it sounds like a romance to hear that
you met as such bitter enemies, and then parted such friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run afoul of him several times, when he had a pack
of warriors at his back, and could have raised my ha&rsquo;r as easy
as say so, but he never offered to do any thing of the kind.
And now think,&rdquo; continued the bear-tamer, in a voice of inexpressible
disgust, &ldquo;that at that time I war looking up something
that could give me a clew to the little pet that I had
found, and that I hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;nough sense to ax Maquesa a single
word, when he could talk English purty well, and was the very
man of all others that could have answered my questions.
You see I found the gal on this side the mountains and met
him on t&rsquo;other, and so it never got through my thick skull
that that all might be, and so I&rsquo;ve gone on ever since without
l&rsquo;arning a single thing, till you come down here and told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your first proceeding, I suppose, will be to seek out
Maquesa, in case we fail to find any trace of Little Rifle before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hang it!&rdquo; exclaimed old Robsart, &ldquo;whar shall I go to
find him? I haven&rsquo;t seen him for two, three years, and don&rsquo;t
know whether he&rsquo;s alive or dead, or whether he&rsquo;s within ten
or five hundred miles, and who shall I ax? It&rsquo;ll just be my
luck to go tramping over Californy, Washington and Oregon
for the next ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you inquire of such Indians as you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old trapper indulged in a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Blackfoot in a thousand can talk English, and you&rsquo;d
have to catch &rsquo;em and tie &rsquo;em up afore you could get an answer
out of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided she is a captive among the Indians, we have an
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
almost hopeless task before us,&rdquo; said Harry, somewhat dispirited
by the sweeping declaration of the trapper, who instantly
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think she is in the hands of the varmints;
we&rsquo;ve got a different kind of work to do than that, and here
we are close to the place where you camped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking their way through the ravine, they speedily stood
upon the very spot where the last glimpse of Little Rifle had
been given Harry Northend. Old Ruff paused, and placing
his feet upon the dead ashes of the camp-fire, looked with a
keen, searching glance about him. He was apparently examining
the minutest objects, determined that not the slightest
clew should escape his scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found out any thing?&rdquo; asked Harry, when he
saw that he was through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blamed thing,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;stand whar you are
for a time, till I take a look at the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, the young lad supposed was the real test of the whole
business, and he watched the actions of the old trapper, with
an interest which it would be impossible to describe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find tracks of yourn and hern here,&rdquo; he said, straightening
up after a long search, &ldquo;but that snow has played the
mischief. It fell arter she left, so as to hide her trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it has melted again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that don&rsquo;t help any; its melting has just shet out
the prints of her moccasins, so that there is no use in trying
to look for &rsquo;em. This s&rsquo;arch has got to be made on general
principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general principles of the hunter meant that, without
seeking to follow, and find their friend by means of palpable
evidence that she had left behind her, it only remained for
them to reason out or conjecture, as to the course she had
taken, and to pursue that.</p>
<p>He gave it as his belief now that the nearest stream, of size,
had been used by her, and that a portion of her flight had
been made upon that.</p>
<p>This meant that the hunt was to be an indefinite one, and
like a prudent man, Old Ruff resolved to make his arrangements,
so that if necessary, he could continue it for several
months. He meant to go into this business to win.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE REDS.</h2>
<p>The first proceeding of old Robsart was to <i>cache</i>&mdash;that is
bury&mdash;his peltries so that they would be safe from molestation
from Indians and meddlers, and he could return in his own
good time and remove them.</p>
<p>Then he made the round of his traps, and sprung them all,
carefully concealing them where they, too, could be found
when he should require them, after which he was ready to
take up the work.</p>
<p>Having failed entirely in discovering any traces of the
means by which Little Rifle had disappeared, the trapper was
now disposed to believe that the Blackfeet had had something
to do with it, and that his search must be made partly among
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know she is purty cute,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but the smartest
man in these parts is likely to run his head in trouble any
time, and she may have done it afore she knowed. I s&rsquo;pose
you want to jine me in this excursion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry, as a matter of course, declared that he did, and the
trapper added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;ll work up toward the fort, for you&rsquo;ll have to see
the old gentleman, so that if you&rsquo;re gone a month or two,
he&rsquo;ll know where you ar&rsquo;, and won&rsquo;t blame me for keepin&rsquo;
away so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all prudent, and the lad had no wish to make
any objection to the arrangement. They shouldered their
rifles, and turning their faces toward the Cascade Range,
started on what was destined to prove the most memorable
venture of their lives.</p>
<p>The old hunter having announced his theory of Little
Rifle&rsquo;s disappearance, it behooved them both to maintain as
sharp a scrutiny as possible upon the different parties of Blackfeet
that were in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; he muttered, with a compressing of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
lips that attested his earnestness, &ldquo;if the varmints have got
the gal, they&rsquo;ve got to keep a mighty close watch on her or
she&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em the slip. Let her have a few hundred yards
the start, and old Maquesa himself couldn&rsquo;t catch her. She
can run like an antelope, and knows how to dodge and double
on herself and hide her own trail, so that a bloodhound would
give up the hunt in disgust, and go to watchin&rsquo; sheep for the
rest of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this case, it seems to me she would have taken
every pains to make her footprints visible, knowing that we
would be on the hunt for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could she know that?&rdquo; asked the old man, in return;
&ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t likely that she got into trouble till she war a good
ways off from camp, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be till then that she
would think of such a thing. Yonder is a purty high hill,
and we&rsquo;ll climb up to the top of that, and take a look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevation alluded to was considerably out of their way,
lying more to the southward; but, as there was a prospect
that it might be of some use to them, they made all haste toward
it.</p>
<p>It was very much of the nature of the ridge where Little
Rifle and Harry had made their morning meal on the previous
day, except that it was higher, and consequently the view was
much more extensive.</p>
<p>When at last they reached the top, the boy was charmed
with the scenery spread out before him. It was indeed one
of the finest views with which he had been favored since
coming to the North-west.</p>
<p>Looking to the east, he saw hundreds of square miles of
forest, prairie, ravines, gorges and mountain-peaks spread out
before him, crossed in every direction by rivers, creeks, torrents,
ca&ntilde;ons and waterfalls, while the deep emerald tinge
of the vegetation, as seen in the spring and early summer,
gave a soft splendor to the whole scene that never could have
been equaled at any other season of the year.</p>
<p>This view was much the same to the north and south,
while in the west it was backed up by that vast snowy range,
whose peaks, in many places, were hid from sight among the
very clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The same alternation of forest, ravine and prairie encountered
the eye in this view, and the soft, mellow haze that enfolded
the distant Cascade Range, gave the landscape a peculiarly
American appearance, such as rarely meets the eye of
the traveler in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The majestic loneliness of the vast solitude was deepened
and made more impressive by the faint view of Fort Abercrombie
in the distance. It was many miles away, standing
in a small elevated clearing. The stockades by which it was
surrounded, and the compact log building itself, resembled
some tiny toy, as they were revealed to the eye.</p>
<p>From a tall flag-staff the Stars and Stripes floated in the
breeze, and the naked eye was just able to detect the evolutions
of the banner as it folded in and out, stretching for an
instant to full length, and then flapping about the staff
again.</p>
<p>It was a sight to kindle the heart of the patriot, as he looked
upon this most beautiful emblem of his country floating to the
breeze in this far-away wilderness, proclaiming to all the protection
they could find beneath its &aelig;gis, and that while they
trod this vast domain, it could be with the consciousness that
they were still upon the soil of their own dear native land,
although perhaps thousands of miles from the spot of their
birth.</p>
<p>The feeling of desolation and loneliness which came upon
one when he looked for the first time upon this immense landscape
of silence was made still greater by the faint signs of
the presence of human beings that were here and there discernible.
The very insignificance and paucity of their number,
as compared with the enormous extent of territory, was
what made the contrast the more impressive.</p>
<p>Several miles to the south, a thin blue column of smoke indicated
the camp-fire of some party; further to the north, a
similar sign showed where another company were gathered,
and between and around these two little halting-places for
human beings, stretched mile after mile and league after
league of unbroken wilderness, in which crouched the bloody
minded Blackfoot and the savage bear.</p>
<p>Of some such a nature as this were the emotions of Harry
Northend, as he stood on the elevation and permitted his eyes
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
to wander off in the direction of the great Cascade Range.
Young, romantic and imaginative, the grand scene produced
a powerful impression upon him, and he stood for several
minutes, forgetful of the grief and anxiety of heart that had
been his when he made his way to this point. His soul was
filled with solemnity and awe, such as come over it in the
presence of the Infinite, and at that moment he felt a pride
in the thought that this was a portion of his country, and a
devout thankfulness that God had thus far protected him from
the dangers and perils that threaten all who venture into these
wilds.</p>
<p>But if the old mountaineer possessed any poetry in his nature,
he had too much on his mind to give any heed to it at
present. Perhaps his familiarity with the sublime scenery of
the grandest portion of our continent had dulled the edge of
his appreciation, or it may be that his mind was so intent on
discovering something tangible by which to continue his hunt
for Little Rifle, that he had no room for any other thought
but be that as it may, his feelings were very different from
those of the lad beside him, as with the field glass in his hand,
he carefully roved over the immense expanse of vision, on the
look-out for some sign that might tell him something of the
loved and lost one.</p>
<p>It was successively turned toward the two camp fires which
we have mentioned, but the survey of neither was very satisfactory.
He learned nothing that could afford him any
grounds for hope, and he withdrew his attention from them,
and pointed the instrument to a broad stream of water that
flowed westward and southward, until it was hid among the
ca&ntilde;ons of the Snowy Range, from which it finally made its
way, and continued onward toward the great Pacific.</p>
<p>On every foot of all that sinuous line of the distant water-course
had Ruff tramped and trapped; over all these hills had
he ranged in his forty years of hill and hunting-life, and, after
Little Rifle came to his lodge, often had the blithe, beautiful
child been his companion in these deeply-enjoyed wanderings.</p>
<p>Carefully his eye roved along the banks of this stream,
wherever they were visible, while the broad silver current did
not escape his survey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Harry, who had recovered in a degree from the awe that
had accompanied his first view, now watched the countenance
and actions of the old trapper. He remarked his slow, steady
shifting of the glass from point to point, until, as his view
ranged along the river for a time, it suddenly paused, and he
gave a slight start.</p>
<p>The lad took this as an indication that his friend had discovered
something, at last, and he was right in his supposition.</p>
<p>Harry carefully avoided speaking, while he saw the trapper
thus engaged, knowing that he would make known, in
his own good time, whatever discovery might reward his
search.</p>
<p>After awhile he handed the glass to the lad, and, pointing
toward the point at which he had been directing it,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a squint out that way and tell me whether you can&rsquo;t
see nothin&rsquo;, or whether you can&rsquo;t see any thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry gladly did as requested, and, as soon as he had the
instrument directed toward the proper point, he saw a party
of half a dozen Indians, who appeared to have just effected a
landing, as a couple of canoes could be seen lying against
the bank. Their motions indicated that they had halted to
kindle a fire, most probably for the purpose of preparing a
meal.</p>
<p>After watching them a few minutes, the boy stated this to
the trapper, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idee; you&rsquo;re right; them canoes show that the
varmints are on the travel. Most likely they&rsquo;ve come from
t&rsquo;other side the mountains and are going back ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re the same ones whose lodges I saw the
other day, and from whom I had such a narrow escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, and it&rsquo;s my opine that they&rsquo;ve had something
to do with the taking off of little pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry started and stared at the hunter in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible? She is then a prisoner in their
lands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind I didn&rsquo;t say <i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied Old Ruff, in his cautious
fashion, &ldquo;but there be some things which I can&rsquo;t tell you
just now that make me think them varmints are mixed up in
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
this business, some way or other, and it&rsquo;ll pay to take a look
around thar camp, even if we don&rsquo;t l&rsquo;arn nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with characteristic promptness, when he had fully
settled in his mind upon the proper course to pursue, old Robsart
started off at a rapid walk in the direction of the camp of
hostile Blackfeet, determined, no matter at what risk, to learn
whether there was any thing to be picked up among these
savage foes.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />BETWEEN TWO FIRES.</h2>
<p>Two hours from the time of starting, Old Ruff and Harry
Northend were within a hundred yards of the Blackfoot
camp.</p>
<p>Fortunately for them, they halted in the midst of a dense
growth of pines, where they had plenty of opportunity to
maneuver and keep themselves invisible.</p>
<p>They were so close to the camp that the voices of the red-skins
could be heard, and Harry even caught the smell of
burning meat, proving that, as the trapper had said, they had
come ashore for the purpose of preparing their meal. Such
being the case, they were not likely to remain in camp for a
very long time.</p>
<p>Robsart had brought the boy closer to this congregation of
red-skins than was prudent, and he expressed regret at doing
so, but the young fellow was so brave and eager that it
was hard to refuse him such a request. But he was determined
that he should not advance another step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay right here where you are,&rdquo; he added, in an impressive
whisper, &ldquo;and keep mighty shady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be supposed that the lad scarcely needed these instructions,
as his own sense would have taught him their importance.</p>
<p>Although he felt equal to the task of reconnoitering the
camp himself, yet he dare not propose such a wild scheme to
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the old hunter, whose especial province it was to attend to
such perilous enterprises himself.</p>
<p>Leaving the latter to carry out the dangerous reconnoissance
upon which he had started, we must take the space to
describe the strange adventure that befell the lad, who, it
would seem, was placed in much the lesser peril.</p>
<p>His situation was interesting and exciting from its proximity
to camp, as he could hear the jingle and mumble and
guttural hum of the Blackfeet, as they gathered around the
fire, eating and smoking in the very <i>abandon</i> of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is much chance of Little Rifle being
there,&rdquo; mused Harry, when he found himself alone. &ldquo;If she
were among them we would have seen something of her with
the telescope, but Old Ruff sees a chance or he wouldn&rsquo;t have
undertaken it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was comparatively an easy matter for Harry to content
himself for a short time, lying down among the bushes,
listening to the noise of the red-skins; but, when a half-hour
had passed, and the noise decreased, and he saw nothing of
old Robsart, he began to feel impatient. He could not understand
why it was that the old hunter should remain away
so long, when he seemed to accomplish nothing thereby. It
seemed to him that the red-skins had all gone asleep or taken
their departure, and he and his friend were wasting valuable
time.</p>
<p>But the half-hour was doubled and trebled, and then the
lad made the exceedingly imprudent resolution to steal a little
ways toward the camp&mdash;just far enough to get the slightest
glimpse, and find out for himself the meaning of this
strange silence and delay. He deemed it necessary only to
crawl forward a short distance, confident that he could detect
the presence of danger in time to withdraw, if indeed
there was any possibility of encountering any such thing.</p>
<p>It was with some twitchings and misgivings that Harry began
creeping forward, knowing that it was in direct violation
of the commands of the old hunter, who would not be apt to
look lightly upon such an offense should he discover it.</p>
<p>This caused him to hesitate a few minutes, but hearing and
seeing nothing more, he began stealing forward on his hands
and knees, advancing inch by inch, frequently pausing and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
listening, and peering round in the undergrowth, so as to
guard against any danger stealing upon him from any direction.</p>
<p>Two or three times he was on the eve of retreating, and
he looked furtively back over the course he had come&mdash;but
the continued silence, and his impatience prevented, and
he pressed on, until he judged that he had passed fully one-half
the distance that intervened between him and his starting-point.</p>
<p>Thus far he had carried his rifle with him, and it had
proved no little impediment, besides incurring the constant
danger of being discharged from the hammer catching in
some of the bushes and undergrowth.</p>
<p>The lad had now reached a point perilously near the Blackfoot
camp, and although he could no longer hear any sounds
of the savages, he felt that a dozen feet further must reveal
them to him, and in all probability solve the question as to
the delay of Robsart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lay my gun down,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;so that I can
crawl a few steps further, in perfect quiet, and with that much
less risk of being discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry was not the simpleton to separate himself voluntarily
from his weapon, when he believed there was the remotest
possibility of his needing it, nor, were the circumstances all
in his favor, would he leave it beyond his reach.</p>
<p>But, it will be remembered that it was a heavy gun, and
that it seriously interfered with his progress; so he laid it
carefully down, pointing the muzzle a little to the right, so
that, in case of accident, no harm could come to him.</p>
<p>Satisfied, then, that he had done no imprudent thing, he
resumed his progress upon his hands and knees, moving slowly,
cautiously and stealthily, eyes and ears on the alert for the
slightest indication of danger.</p>
<p>All was still&mdash;nothing being heard but the soft flow of the
river, and softly drawing the undergrowth aside, he crept onward,
until he was fully a dozen feet from where his gun lay.</p>
<p>Still he was unable to catch the coveted glimpse of the
camp, and he paused, thinking that there was already too
great a distance between him and his weapon, and resolved
to return and bring it back and place it nearer to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>But the path which he had made in his panther-like progress
was clear and open, and he could dart backward in an
instant and seize it; and so, hesitating but a few seconds, he
resumed his advance, with the determination that, at the most,
he should not go more than a yard further&mdash;just enough to
pass through an unusually matted mass of vegetation, that feebly
barred in his progress.</p>
<p>One step further, and both hands sunk into a cavity in the
ground, a couple of feet in depth&mdash;so suddenly and unexpectedly
that he pitched head-foremost, making a terrible breaking
and threshing of the shrubbery.</p>
<p>Harry was not hurt in the least, but he was almost paralyzed
with terror; for he was certain that the whole camp
must be alarmed, and the Blackfeet would be swarming
around his head before he could rise or make any attempt to
retreat.</p>
<p>He did not seek to do so, but lay still, listening with a
throbbing heart, and conjuring all manner of dreadful consequences
that were sure to follow this mishap upon his part.
As a matter of course he lamented his rashness, with the most
bitter feelings, but it was all useless now, and he lay still, with
a grim resolve to take the punishment unflinchingly.</p>
<p>A few seconds only had passed, when he heard footsteps,
but to his surprise, instead of being in front, they were in the
rear. Some one was approaching from that direction!</p>
<p>Like a flash he thought of his gun, and of the supremely
silly thing he had done in placing it beyond his reach. As
he was about to scramble forth in an attempt to reach it before
his enemy, it occurred to him that it might be Old Ruff,
who was searching for him. He would have preferred almost
to have seen a Blackfoot, rather than be caught in this dilemma
by the trapper, for the latter, discovering his foolhardiness
this early in the business, would be certain to lose all patience
with him, and send him on to the fort, while he continued
the hunt alone.</p>
<p>The poor lad was in a sad predicament, not daring to move
from where he was, in either direction; for to retreat would
only bring him face to face with the Blackfoot, if such he
were, and to advance would be to throw himself into the
hands of the whole party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if he catches me here,&rdquo; he reflected, in the intensity
of his chagrin, &ldquo;he will find me without any weapon except
the knife and telescope,&rdquo; and he added, with something of
his natural drollery, &ldquo;there is no need of my looking through
the glass to bring the danger any nearer, or to make it appear
any bigger; for it is too near and too big already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extreme slowness of the party approaching him satisfied
Harry that it must be an Indian scout, who may have
been on the look-out for just such interlopers as he.</p>
<p>At the same time he thought the red-skin was making an
unusual racket, for such a proceeding. He could hear the
motion of the feet&mdash;soft and heavy&mdash;and the bending and
breaking of the shrubbery beneath his passage, as though he
was taking no pains to hide his approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of it?&rdquo; he reflected; &ldquo;he knows he&rsquo;s got
a sure thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time he gave up all hope or fear of its being old
Robsart, and was certain that it was one of the dreaded Indians,
who, knowing that there was no escape for the lad,
was toying and trifling with him, as a cat toys with a mouse
before devouring it.</p>
<p>In the intensity of his fear in this direction, Harry forgot
all about the camp in front, and had no time to wonder at the
continued silence in that direction, a circumstance which
would have struck him as very strange, under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The crackling and treading of the undergrowth continued,
and the suspense soon became greater than the actual coming
of the danger itself would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I don&rsquo;t see any way out of the scrape,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;I may as well end it one way or the other, and so I will
meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a faint hope, too, that by stealing along on the
ground, he might secure his rifle in time to make a fight for
his life.</p>
<p>Accordingly he started with the same care and caution that
had marked his approach to the camp.</p>
<p>A half-dozen feet were passed in this manner, and then he
paused, stupefied with wonder, amazement and absolute terror!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>For of all the strange sights and experiences that he had
encountered in this country, of all that had been his during
his past life, he never had seen any thing that could compare
with that which now greeted his vision!</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />A WONDERFUL ANIMAL.</h2>
<p>As Harry Northend crept out from beneath the matted
undergrowth, that surrounded the Blackfoot camp, and came
in view of his rifle, where he had left it lying upon the
ground, he saw not Old Ruff Robsart, nor a repulsive Indian,
but a grizzly bear.</p>
<p>And not such a bear as naturalists and hunters tell us
about, of a black or tawny color, but something <i>sui generis</i>&mdash;something
such as he was sure no mortal had ever heard of
before, or was ever to hear of again.</p>
<p>For, instead of being of the midnight hue that universally
characterizes his species, this one was striped with green
and blue and red from head to tail!</p>
<p>As soon as the lad had recovered in a degree his self-possession,
he rubbed his eyes and looked again, doubting
whether he had seen aright.</p>
<p>Yes; there was no mistake about it. There was the
creature, the conformation of his head and body proving that
he was a genuine grizzly bear beyond all question, and the
only remarkable thing about him was his color, and that
surely was remarkable enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of men seeing such things as that,&rdquo; he
mused, as, crouching on his hands and knees, he riveted his
eyes upon it, &ldquo;but it was always when they were drunk, and
I am sure I have never been in that condition, and never
shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear was of rather large size, but not unusually so,
but the lad judged from his appearance that he was very
fierce and savage, and, in his way, was probably as dangerous
as a half-dozen red-skins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>His alarm would have been somewhat less had the position
of the creature been such as to afford him a hope of securing
his gun; but, as matters stood, that was clearly out of
the question.</p>
<p>For the mottled grizzly was snuffing and clawing the weapon
as if he had some curiosity to find out its use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether he thinks he knows how to use it,&rdquo;
muttered Harry, as he slowly sunk down upon his face, in
the hope of escaping his eye. &ldquo;If he did know how to
handle a rifle, I couldn&rsquo;t be more astonished than I am at the
color of his coat. He <i>does</i> act as if he understood what it is
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear poked the barrel and stock around with his nose,
then rattled his long claws over it, as though he was not exactly
satisfied with its appearance. When Harry saw that it
lay so that the muzzle pointed directly at him, he concluded
that the danger was getting too serious and complicated for
him to remain idle.</p>
<p>Indians between him and the river, a grizzly bear before
his face, and a loaded rifle pointed straight at his head, with
very strong chances of its being discharged by the clumsy
clawing and scratching of the brute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll back a little nearer the camp,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;for if I can get down in that hollow again, the bullet will
pass over my head, and the monster may miss seeing me altogether,
until I can get further out the way, if that nose of
his don&rsquo;t scent me out, or if his brains don&rsquo;t tell him that
when he comes upon a gun like that, in these parts, the owner
isn&rsquo;t apt to be far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the movement made by Harry caught the ear of the
bear, who raised his head as quick as a flash, and, catching
sight of him, he &ldquo;went for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was only fairly ensconced in the cavity alluded
to, and had turned to see whether he could maintain his invisibility,
when he saw the frightful monster almost upon
him.</p>
<p>In the presence of this threatened immediate death, it was
natural that the boy should run into the other danger, and
with a howl of terror, he sprung up from the ground and
struck straight for the Blackfoot camp, preferring in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
flurry of the moment to run into their embrace than to remain
and take a hug from the bear.</p>
<p>Only a few leaps, and he landed directly in the open space,
where the red-skins, a short time before, had partaken of their
meal.</p>
<p>But, not one was to be seen. The fire was still burning,
but all had departed.</p>
<p>Harry paused a single instant, looking about with an inquiring
stare, and then, hearing the bear directly behind him,
he made a dash forward, and catching up one of the sticks
that was still burning, he circled it swiftly over his head, fanning
it into a blaze, and with this potent weapon he turned
about to face his foe.</p>
<p>It was a fortunate thought in the young man, for the
bravest wild animal can never screw up his courage to the
point of advancing straight upon fire; but for all that such a
precaution was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Harry had scarcely placed himself upon the defensive,
when he heard something very much like a laugh, immediately
behind him; but he did not dare turn his head in the
presence of this horrible creature.</p>
<p>The bear instead of halting before the blazing brand,
seemed to be on the point of advancing straight upon the boy,
when the latter, holding the flaming brand before him, turned
the tables, by moving directly toward him.</p>
<p>This checked the bear, and at the same instant that familiar
laugh struck upon the ear of Harry, followed by the
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down yer candle! He won&rsquo;t hurt you! Ain&rsquo;t
he a booty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the voice of Old Ruff Robsart and no mistake.
The boy hardly dared to turn his head to see, but the trapper
made it unnecessary, by walking forward and placing
himself directly beside him.</p>
<p>As he did so, he reached out, and taking the torch from
his hand flung it away, and then gave out a peculiar whistle.</p>
<p>Instantly the bear came forward, lumbering awkwardly,
but with many indications of pleasure at the sound of the
hunter&rsquo;s voice, who continued addressing him by pet names
until he was within reach, when he patted him familiarly
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
upon his head, and at another signal or command, the mottled
phenomenon rose upon its haunches, moving its fore-legs
like the flippers of a turtle, while its large hazel eyes were
fixed upon Old Ruff, with an expression almost human in its
intelligence.</p>
<p>By this time Harry Northend had gotten the suspicion that
the trapper and this speckled wonder were old acquaintances.
They surely met as such, and their conduct continued to give
color to the suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your old heart!&rdquo; exclaimed the trapper, advancing
and throwing his arms about the hairy neck of the bear,
&ldquo;next to my little pet, I&rsquo;d rather meet you than any other
critter that tramps the woods. You look as though you&rsquo;d
got along purty well sence I gave you a leave of absence,
last fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the two old friends were engaged in their fraternal
demonstrations, Harry concluded to slip around and secure
his gun. That would be only prudent, while he had great
fear that old Robsart would discover his inexcusably defenseless
condition.</p>
<p>He saw that strange and unnatural as the animal looked,
there was nothing to be feared from it, and he passed within
arm&rsquo;s length of it, into the wood from which it had emerged
but a few minutes before, and a few steps brought him to his
gun, lying unharmed upon the ground.</p>
<p>Hastily catching this up, he lost no time in rejoining the
two friends&mdash;human and brute&mdash;that were fraternizing upon
the deserted camp-ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the name of the Seven Wonders did that creature
come from?&rdquo; he asked, as he saw the old hunter leaning
on his rifle contemplating what was evidently a great pet.
The face of the trapper was expanded with a fearful grin,
while he occasionally shook in a way that showed he was
stirred by mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere critter is what I call Speckled Beauty! I
cotched him five years ago, when he war a little cub. He allers
had a good temper, and I fotched him up and made him
one of the best-tamed critters I ever saw. Old Griz&rsquo; Adams
never had a neater critter, and Little Rifle&mdash;why she and that
b&rsquo;ar war great cronies, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that color!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, &ldquo;surely that is not
natural! If it is, he is worth a very fortune to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in course not; hair don&rsquo;t grow green and blue even
on a grizzly bear. I had that critter so well-tamed that he
was just like a dog. He used to go off on a hunt for three
or four days at a time, but was always sure to come back
ag&rsquo;in. He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t of much use to me, and so I let him go and
come as he chose, and when I hadn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; better to do, I
used to wrastle and tumble with him and teach him tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I am anxious to hear how he gained such a coat as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Ruff laughed as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last summer I was in at the fort, to take &rsquo;em some antelope-meat,
that I had promised, when one of these long-nosed,
genuine Yankees come in. He was on the look-out for something
to make money of, no matter what it was, and when he
see&rsquo;d my b&rsquo;ar prancing around, he proposed that we should
go into partnership, and show him around through the States;
but I told him one b&rsquo;ar wasn&rsquo;t enough to travel on, and then
he said that he&rsquo;d fix him. He had a lot of dyes and paints
with him that he said he had got up on a patent of his own,
and was going to sell to the Injins, and he painted up the
b&rsquo;ar in high style. The dye was the genuine stuff, for though
the b&rsquo;ar was as black as jet it took hold, and made him a purtier
color than you see him now, &rsquo;cause you know he has shed
a good deal of his coat sence then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idee of this chap was to take him round the country
showing him off as a phenomenon, but I see&rsquo;d that he thought
it was such a big spec&rsquo; that he wanted to have the whole job
in his own hands&mdash;so I told him to take him and go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised to send me half his profits, but I knowed
that if he got away with the b&rsquo;ar I&rsquo;d never see either of &rsquo;em
ag&rsquo;in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I reckon he didn&rsquo;t get fur away, fur the next day
the Speckled Beauty come back lookin&rsquo; fur me and Little
Rifle. He had the seat of the Yankee&rsquo;s trowsers in his mouth,
and so I made up my mind that they&rsquo;d had a falling out. I
left the fort that day, but I l&rsquo;arned that the Yankee come in
the next day to get a new seat to his breeches, and left for
Fr&rsquo;isco, swearin&rsquo; thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any chance for an honest man to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
make a living in these parts. Since that time, Speckled
Beauty has been trampin&rsquo; the woods as he pleases, but he
seems to have got weaned away. I s&rsquo;pose &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s come
arter us so often, without findin&rsquo; me or Little Pet at home.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />WHAT THE TELESCOPE REVEALED.</h2>
<p>All this was very entertaining, especially when &ldquo;Speckled
Beauty,&rdquo; the hero of the tale, was before the listener, prancing
and cavorting, as though he appreciated the compliments
of the old mountaineer, but Harry could not forget the fact
that their errand was to discover Little Rifle, of whose fate
as yet they had not gained the slightest inkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle Ruff, what of <i>her</i>? Have you no good news
to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sobered on the instant the question was asked, and
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard not. You see I had an idee that Maquesa
was at the head of this party, and, as soon as I got in good
range of &rsquo;em, I laid down and watched. I counted &rsquo;em over
a half-dozen times, and found thar war just eight. But the
old codger wasn&rsquo;t among &rsquo;em. To make sarten, I waited in
the bushes till they all got aboard and shoved off, thinkin&rsquo;
p&rsquo;raps Maquesa was somewhar out of sight; but he warn&rsquo;t,
and then I started to hunt you up, and found you and Speckled
Beauty, waltzin&rsquo; &rsquo;round the camp-ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you had seen the Blackfoot chief,&rdquo; inquired
Harry, &ldquo;suppose you had discovered that he was at the head
of this little party, what clew would that have given you?
What would such a fact have told you about Little Rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an idee that if I seen him, I&rsquo;d see the gal too.
If them varmints hadn&rsquo;t looked so mighty ugly, I&rsquo;d gone in
among &rsquo;em, and axed about the health of Maquesa, and l&rsquo;arned
whether he&rsquo;d been seen in these parts lately, but it didn&rsquo;t look
as though thar war much show fur me. Still I believe that
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
that varmint is at the bottom of this business, and the fust
thing I&rsquo;m going to l&rsquo;arn is whether he&rsquo;s been seen in this
neighborhood. If he has he&rsquo;s the roo-ter we&rsquo;re going fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ruff,&rdquo; said Harry, as a bright idea struck him,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there some way in which we can turn this bear to account?
It seems to me that such a strange, wonderful-looking
animal would scare any Indian out of his wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve used him fur,&rdquo; replied the bear-tamer.
&ldquo;These Blackfeet don&rsquo;t know much about hair-dye and such
stuff, though they can paint up their faces, and when they
see Speckled Beauty they&rsquo;re apt to think he&rsquo;s something of a
spirit. Ef he&rsquo;ll only scare <i>them</i> as much as he does these
younkers that go snoopin&rsquo; &rsquo;round Injin camps, they&rsquo;ll never
git over it, as long as they live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could but &ldquo;acknowledge the corn,&rdquo; pleading as an
excuse that any one unacquainted with Speckled Beauty
could not look upon him without agitation.</p>
<p>Old Ruff then announced his intention of continuing the
pursuit of these red-skins toward the Cascade Range, as he
had strong reason to suspect that they would be joined by
Maquesa before they advanced much further.</p>
<p>Harry was unable to understand what his reasons were for
this persistent belief, but he knew he was too clear-headed to
follow any phantom, and that there was good cause to expect
tangible results from such a course.</p>
<p>But, there remained the trifling difficulty already alluded
to. This course was taking them further and further away
from the fort, and the old hunter could not consent that the
lad should accompany him, until he had received the permission
of his father.</p>
<p>This necessitated quite a <i>detour</i>, and the loss of much valuable
time; but happily this necessity was averted by the unexpected
appearance of Mr. Northend himself.</p>
<p>While the two were talking, they heard voices, and the
next moment three men emerged to view. All were mounted
upon horses, and one was a hunter and guide well known to
old Robsart, who instantly went forward to greet him, while
Harry hurried up to salute his parent.</p>
<p>Considerable time was passed before a full understanding
all round was reached. Mr. Northend, under the guidance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Matt Muggs, a noted scout, was making a sort of tour with a
friend through this part of Oregon, in the interests of the
Missouri Fur Company, and was now on his way back to Fort
Abercrombie, with the intention of soon leaving there for
home by way of San Francisco.</p>
<p>It required considerable persuasion before he would give
his consent for his son to go off on what he termed this
&ldquo;wild-goose expedition,&rdquo; but he finally gave in, and, after
some further exchange of friendly converse, and the acceptance
of quite a sum of money upon the part of the boy, in order to
defray all possible expenses, the two parties were about separating
to go their respective ways, when old Robsart, noticing
that the trio had come by a route that must have given
them a view of the river, asked Matt whether he had seen
any thing of a party of Blackfeet within the last hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; was the instant response; &ldquo;thar&rsquo;s a party of
&rsquo;em less nor a mile off in thar boats, steerin&rsquo; straight for the
kenyon in the mountains. As they was a-comin&rsquo; from this
way you must have see&rsquo;d the same skunks, Ruff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; replied the hunter; &ldquo;them&rsquo;s the coves we&rsquo;re
follerin&rsquo;. Did you count &rsquo;em, Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allers does that, when I kin git a fair squint at &rsquo;em.
They war in two canoes, and thar war just ten of &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">What?</span>&rdquo; demanded old Robsart in great excitement, &ldquo;sure
of that, Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I kin count ten, ef I can&rsquo;t count any more, and I
ciphered up them skunks twice, as I had an all-fired notion of
takin&rsquo; a crack at one of &rsquo;em. Howsumever, you can ax Mr.
Farrell, or Northend here, &rsquo;cause they seen &rsquo;em too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the latter gentleman, &ldquo;I remember distinctly
that Matt remarked that there were ten, upon which I counted
them and found that he was right. But, why are you so
deeply interested in this particular party?&rdquo; asked Northend,
as he reined up his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I think that little pet that I&rsquo;m arter is among &rsquo;em,
that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you noticed, Matt, if the old chief
Maquesa was with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the hunter, &ldquo;they war just fur enough off
for me to see fairly, and I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout nothin&rsquo; of the
kind, or I&rsquo;d tuk a little closer peep on your account. If you
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
think the little gal is among &rsquo;em you&rsquo;d better be off with your
Speckled Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three horsemen paused for some time to watch the
curiously colored animal, as it went prancing and lumbering
after its master, and when it was out of sight, they resumed
their progress toward the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought,&rdquo; exclaimed Old Ruff, in some excitement,
as soon as they were alone; &ldquo;the pet is thar, and she
and Maquesa make up the extra two, that Matt spoke about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, where did they join the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhar further &rsquo;long, and I b&rsquo;lieve now,&rdquo; continued
the mountaineer in his emphatic way, &ldquo;that the whole caboodle
of &rsquo;em have come over here after Little Rifle. Maquesa
has l&rsquo;arned somethin&rsquo; that has made him s&rsquo;pect the gal
that was left in his charge is the same one that I&rsquo;ve been
bringin&rsquo; up, and he&rsquo;s come over the mountains in s&rsquo;arch of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that looks reasonable,&rdquo; replied Harry, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t
heard or thought of any thing yet that can make me understand
the course of Little Rifle in the business. <i>That</i> is the
mystery which passes my comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A troubled look crossed the face of the hunter, and he
stared earnestly in the countenance of the lad for a moment,
and then asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can?&rdquo; replied Harry, intensely eager to hear his
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I can&mdash;I can see it all; I know more &rsquo;bout the pet
than you do, and it all come to me why she left you in that
style, when you war asleep by the camp-fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Northend stared wonderingly at the hunter, as if he
doubted his sanity. But the old man was never in clearer
mood, and he was in dead earnest. But now, when the very
words seemed trembling upon his tongue, he hesitated, as if
unwilling to pronounce them. He appeared indeed to control
his emotions only by the strongest effort.</p>
<p>Harry waited, wondering what the words would be; but
they came not, and the trapper, who had partly paused in his
walk, now walked faster, as if seeking to get away from some
exceedingly painful recollection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Under any other circumstances, the lad would have respected
this embarrassment upon the part of his friend; but, where
Little Rifle was concerned, he was unwilling to do so, and he
put the question direct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you were going to say about our lost
friend? You have raised my curiosity, and I hope it wasn&rsquo;t
merely for the purpose of tantalizing it by a refusal to reveal
what it is you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robsart was silent a moment, and then he spoke briefly but
with much feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t do it fur that, younker, fur I think too much
of you&mdash;but I was in too much of a hurry when I spoke; I
can&rsquo;t tell you yit; the time will come after awhile; wait till
then; I won&rsquo;t forgit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no refusing such a request as this, much as it
distressed Harry to do so. He resolved that he would make
no further reference to the matter until the trapper, in his
own good time, should see fit to make clear the mysterious
references that had escaped his lips.</p>
<p>The great purpose now was to overhaul the Blackfoot
party before they got beyond their reach. This seemed easy
enough, as they had no cause to fear pursuit, and their quite
lengthy halt for dinner looked as if they intended to continue
their journey in a very leisurely manner.</p>
<p>True they had their canoes, and if they chose they could
easily maintain a speed that would carry them much more
swiftly than their pursuers, but they were not likely to do so,
for the simple reason, that there was no occasion (at least in
their estimation) for such haste, and Maquesa was not a chief
who was accustomed to run away from an enemy, even when
he was more powerful than he.</p>
<p>And so, making all haste, the two continued down the
banks of the river, moving almost due westward, until they
struck another elevation which gave them an extended view of
the river flowing away before them. And to their delight they
saw the two canoes about half a mile distant, paddling along
with a tardy deliberation, that showed they thought and cared
little for all who might choose to follow them.</p>
<p>In an instant, Old Ruff had Harry&rsquo;s telescope to his eye. In
a moment his face lit up and he passed it back again with:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take a squint at that front canoe, and tell me what you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the boy looked and saw beyond all mistake, that Little
Rifle was sitting in the forward canoe!</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />DOWN THE RIVER.</h2>
<p>The vision as told by the field-glass could but inspire both
Old Ruff and Harry Northend with the liveliest hope and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Again and again they looked through the instrument, although
the first glance had shown them Little Rifle&rsquo;s identity
beyond all question.</p>
<p>Her size and dress, and general appearance, so distinct from
that of the Blackfeet by which she was surrounded, made it
impossible to mistake her. The trapper was almost equally
positive, that the form immediately next to her was that of
the chief Maquesa&mdash;although in this, his conclusion was
hardly based upon what the glass revealed, but upon his own
knowledge and previous supposition of the Indian&rsquo;s part in
the abduction of the girl.</p>
<p>Passing the telescope back to Harry, the two instantly resumed
their pursuit of the canoes, the mottled grizzly following
them with the same dog-like fondness and obedience, now
and then lumbering out of sight, but never for any length of
time.</p>
<p>The hopeful enthusiasm of the two friends was somewhat
modified by the fact that the afternoon was almost gone, and
the Blackfeet appeared to be paddling with greater speed
than they had used heretofore.</p>
<p>Unless they came ashore to encamp for the night, there
was indeed little probability of their being overtaken. Old
Robsart, who had horses at the fort, was more than once inclined
to procure them for use in the pursuit. He would not
have hesitated to do so, had the Blackfeet themselves been
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
mounted, or had he believed there was any prospect of his
being permitted to choose his own route.</p>
<p>But his purpose was to keep close upon the trail of Maquesa,
in case he should secure it, and this could only be done
by traveling afoot or by using a boat.</p>
<p>A good many miles still intervened between where they
stood and the kenyon of the river, and nothing just now
would have been more welcome than a canoe, with which he
could not only proceed much faster, but which would also
give the legs of himself and Harry a good rest&mdash;a desirable
thing, so far at least as the latter was concerned.</p>
<p>Believing there was good prospect of finding one, he kept
close to the river, on the alert, cautioning the boy to do the
same. The latter was afraid that by this means they would
become hopelessly separated from the bear, but the old man
showed his confidence in the sagacity of the creature, by declaring
that he would not permit himself to be lost by such
means.</p>
<p>As they came down from their elevated position, they
naturally lost sight of the canoes, and Harry could hardly repress
his impatience lest they should fail altogether in finding
them again; but the trapper, as he moved on with his long,
loping strides, seemed as cool and confident of the issue as if
he were only making a round of his traps.</p>
<p>The nature of the ground compelled them to leave the
river at intervals, but never long enough to make them feel
that there was any danger of their passing on beyond the
Blackfeet without discovering them.</p>
<p>The sun went down, and twilight told of the coming of
darkness, but still, although our friends were close upon the
margin of the swiftly flowing stream, nothing was to be seen
either of the canoes or of their camp-fire.</p>
<p>Despite the excitement that had kept up the spirits of
Harry, it was impossible that he should maintain this gait
without growing weary. He felt that he could not maintain
it much longer, but still he hurried forward, determined not
to give up so long as he could keep his legs, and prevent himself
from falling behind his tireless companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa! here it is!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Old Ruff, as he
abruptly halted. &ldquo;Just the thing I&rsquo;ve been looking fur all
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the arternoon. Now, my boy, you can rest them pegs of
yourn, fur I know they can&rsquo;t stand this sort of thing much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he stooped down, and lifted from the ground
directly before him, one of those small, delicately framed Indian
canoes, which are intended to carry but a single person,
but which, in case of emergency, are capable of floating a
couple.</p>
<p>Glad enough was the boy to ensconce himself in the stern,
where, nestling down in as comfortable a position as he could
assume, he felt that he could remain a week at least, before
he would long to indulge in pedestrianism again.</p>
<p>Robsart flung him the heavy Indian blanket, which he always
carried with him when on his travels, and told him to
rest while he could, for there was no telling how long the
opportunity would be his, and then taking the long, flat paddle
in hand, he made ready to turn to the best account the
chance that was given him.</p>
<p>Speckled Beauty stood on the edge of the shore as they
pushed off, and gave utterance to a whine or rather growl like
the mastiff, who is begging his master to take him along. The
trapper replied in a language which, if not understood by
Harry Northend, seemed to be comprehended by the brute&mdash;who
instantly began following them down-stream, until he
was hid by the intervening gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t give it up so,&rdquo; laughed Old Ruff, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll warrant
you when we land, he&rsquo;ll be close by and won&rsquo;t wait long
afore showing himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper felt the need of haste, and he now used the
paddle with all the power and skill of which he was master.
The current was quite rapid, the stream being narrow and
deep, and the light canoe seemed to speed over the surface
like a swallow.</p>
<p>There was a chilliness in the air, and gathering the thick
blanket about him, Harry lay back, too tired to sleep, but so
utterly used up, that he wished the Blackfeet would keep up
their rowing for several hours yet, so that by the time they
halted, he would be in a better condition to do something.
He was sure that he was useless for the present.</p>
<p>Although the old hunter said little, he understood the condition
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
of the lad, and he hoped very much the same as he did.
He let him alone, wishing that he would fall asleep, for he
very justly mistrusted his ability to cope with the physical requirements
before him.</p>
<p>The sky was clear, and the moon was not likely to rise
until later. The trapper continued his powerful sweeps of
the paddle, his purpose being to make the distance between
himself and the Blackfeet as small as was prudent, when he
could slacken his gait, and prolong the pursuit all through the
night if necessary.</p>
<p>Fully five miles were passed in this manner, the stream frequently
making such short curves that he held up, fearful
that he might betray himself to his foes. As yet he had seen
and heard nothing of them, when as he rounded a rocky
headland, he abruptly paused and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear any thing, younker?&rdquo; he asked, holding the
paddle suspended in hand.</p>
<p>There was no answer, even after he had repeated the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor chap, he&rsquo;s asleep!&rdquo; concluded the trapper, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
glad of it. I shan&rsquo;t wake him till I have to. He&rsquo;s full of
pluck and nerve, but he ain&rsquo;t used to this business; he&rsquo;s got
to get older afore he kin stand it as well as me. I don&rsquo;t
know much &rsquo;bout such things, but I think he loves that gal,
and she feels sorter the same toward him. I don&rsquo;t know what
he&rsquo;d think if I&rsquo;d tell him why she left his camp the other
night. He&rsquo;s got to find it out some time, and I won&rsquo;t distress
him by tellin&rsquo; him until I can&rsquo;t put it off any longer. &rsquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he listened, he heard faintly but distinctly the sound of
paddles. His experienced ear enabled him to tell that two
canoes were only a short distance ahead, so there could be no
reasonable doubt but that he was close in the rear of the
Blackfeet party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder ef they&rsquo;re going to keep it up all night?&rdquo; was
the next thought of Old Ruff; &ldquo;ef they are, I kin paddle as
well as them, but then it ain&rsquo;t going to give me much chance
to get a word with Little Rifle, and it will sorter bother the
brains of Speckled Beauty to keep the hang of things. But
he&rsquo;s smart, and has done &rsquo;cuter things than that, in his
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>He did not forget to handle his own paddle with all the
care possible, for the most awkward consequences might follow
a discovery upon the part of Maquesa that some one was
following him.</p>
<p>In the still, calm night, sound was conveyed some distance
with wonderful distinctness. To the casual ear, the red-skins
were no more than a hundred yards distant, but he knew that
triple that breadth of water separated them, and he was enabled
to judge also the exact speed with which they were progressing.</p>
<p>The trapper had no wish to lessen this space, and he took
good care not to do so. His wish was that they would land,
and give him a chance to bring things to an issue.</p>
<p>Once he was filled with misgiving, when, as he paused to
listen, he was unable to catch the slightest sound of their paddles.
He concluded at once that he had betrayed himself, and
Maquesa had given the word for his warriors to halt until
their pursuer should come up and place himself in their
power.</p>
<p>Old Robsart was not the man to do this, and he halted, too,
holding his paddle ready to send his boat back again with its
arrow-like speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef they want a race, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
make a present of my scalp to any red-skin kin cotch me in a
fair canoe-chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was apparently some other cause that had produced
this temporary cessation in their paddling, for the next minute
it was resumed with the same regular sweep as before.</p>
<p>The trapper permitted his boat to remain stationary until
the distance had been greatly increased, when he resumed his
pursuit, with a caution and silence that made it impossible for
the trained and listening ear to detect his coming. He appreciated
the position too keenly to make any mistake at such
a critical time.</p>
<p>He did not speak again, but, lifting the paddle, pushed the
shoulder of Harry vigorously; but he was in too sound a slumber
to awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep on,&rdquo; muttered Old Ruff, as he cautiously impelled
the canoe. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t of any account now, and you&rsquo;re safe
till morning any way. If there&rsquo;s any ticklish business to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
done to-night, I&rsquo;d rather have you asleep than awake. I left
you up the river, and gave you orders not to stir; but you
couldn&rsquo;t wait till I come back, and ef the varmints hadn&rsquo;t left
jist when they did, you&rsquo;d had us both in the ugliest scrape of
our lives. I&rsquo;ll pay him for that, yet,&rdquo; added Old Ruff, with a
shake of his head; &ldquo;when I take younkers to train, they&rsquo;ve
got to obey orders. Ah! what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Blackfeet ahead had ceased paddling again. Certain
that they had heard nothing of him, old Robsart was naturally
curious to know the cause, and he ceased, too, permitting his
canoe to float with the current.</p>
<p>For several seconds every thing remained as silent as the
tomb, and then he detected a sound which he understood too
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he growled, with a grin of delight. &ldquo;The varmints
have landed to go into camp, and now the fun will begin!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />&ldquo;SPECKLED BEAUTY&rdquo; IN CAMP.</h2>
<p>The old hunter kept his canoe motionless in the current
until he was certain that every one of the Blackfeet had left
their boats, and had pulled them up on the shore, beyond
danger of being swept away by the current.</p>
<p>Even then he waited until no doubt could remain of their
intention to kindle a fire and to make a prolonged halt. As
soon as he caught the first twinkle of their camp-fire, he shot
his boat swiftly to the bank, and stepping softly out, drew the
prow clean up out of the water, beneath some overhanging
bushes, where it could not be seen by any one who might accidentally
pass near.</p>
<p>Not the slightest movement indicated that there was any
danger of awakening on the part of the lad, and confident
that there was not, he only paused long enough to gather the
bushes a little more compactly about the boat, so as to make
the concealment as perfect as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Old Ruff then, with rifle in hand, straightened up and looked
off in the darkness, turning his gaze up instead of down the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear any thing of Speckled Beauty,&rdquo; he mused;
&ldquo;but I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve traveled a little too fast in the darkness for
him to keep track of us all the way; but he&rsquo;ll be along arter
awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this confident conclusion, he moved off in the direction
of the camp-fire, which was now burning brightly and
cheerily, and the bustle and activity of the red-skins about the
blaze made the scene interesting if not cheerful to the ordinary
looker-on.</p>
<p>It was an easy matter for the trapper to reconnoiter the
camp of a foe at night, and he moved leisurely along until he
reached a point from which he was afforded the best view
possible of the congregated Blackfeet.</p>
<p>The latter had brought a haunch of venison with them,
which was being cooked over the fire, most of the Indians
moving hither and thither, while one or two were lazily
stretched out upon the ground, smoking their pipes.</p>
<p>Upon a fallen tree, near the blaze, sat Little Rifle. Her
head was bent, and an Indian blanket was gathered about her,
so that her face could not be seen by the trapper, although
he stood directly in front of her.</p>
<p>But it needed not the sight of the beautiful little weapon
lying at her feet, for the old man to identify her. If he was
enabled to do so when half a mile distant, there was no mistaking
now, when no more than a hundred feet separated.</p>
<p>After watching her intently for a minute or two, in the
hope that she would raise her eyes, the trapper turned his
gaze upon Maquesa, who, lounging at her feet, was looking
up in her face and talking. Old Ruff could catch the mumble
of his voice now and then, when there was a lull in the
racket made by the others, and he could see from his manner
that he was deeply in earnest about something, though unable
to catch a syllable that he uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what that means,&rdquo; growled the hunter, as
he fairly glared upon the red-skin. &ldquo;I was afeard of it. Ef
it hadn&rsquo;t been fur that desprit fight that me and Maquesa had,
and the consequent love atween us, I&rsquo;d put a bullet <i>spang</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
through him, from whar I stand, though I s&rsquo;pose the red-skin
does mean well enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the watcher heard a crackling off to the
right, and turning his head, he saw, to his dismay, Speckled
Beauty, the gorgeous grizzly bear, emerge from the gloom,
and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, walk directly toward the
camp-fire.</p>
<p>Robsart would have prevented this had it been possible;
but he had forgotten all about the animal for the time, and
he could not have signaled to him, or crossed his path, without
betraying himself to the group of savages. So, with no
little chagrin, he stood where he was and watched the antics
of his pet.</p>
<p>Speckled Beauty, coming to the camp-fire under the impression
that it was kindled by his friends, and descrying
Little Rifle, had turned his steps toward her, as the best he
could do under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The moment he came within the circle of light, there was
a furious uproar, and nearly every red-skin sprung for his
rifle. Maquesa leaped to his feet, greatly startled by this tumult;
but before any one could discharge their pieces, he recognized
the brute and forbade them firing.</p>
<p>Little Rifle also raised her head for an instant, looked steadily
at the bear, and then, without changing her position, looked
down again, drawing the blanket about her shoulders, and
seemingly indifferent to what was going on about her.</p>
<p>The tumult and confusion created by the Blackfeet alarmed
Speckled Beauty, and caused him to pause in his walk toward
the girl. He glared at the red-skins, and then apparently
scenting danger in the sight of so many guns, turned squarely
about and lumbered off in the darkness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done all the mischief he can, out thar,&rdquo; growled Old
Ruff, impatiently, &ldquo;and now he&rsquo;ll nose around till he finds
the Yankee or me, and make every thing ten times worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to suspect that he had made a blunder in bringing
the curiosity along; for Maquesa, knowing to whom he
belonged, would be very apt to suspect that his master was
somewhere in the neighborhood, and placed thus upon his
guard, the labor that Robsart had laid out for himself, would
be increased ten-fold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>This was the mischief that undoubtedly had been already
committed; but fearful that Harry Northend would also betray
his position, when suddenly aroused from his slumber by
the snout of the bear, thrust against his face, the trapper
cautiously withdrew from his advanced position, and circling
around, came to the river-bank, a short distance above where
he had left the boat.</p>
<p>He was none too soon, for at the same instant he saw the
outlines of the dark, cumbrous body of his pet bear, which
gave a growl of pleasure, as he recognized his master, and
hurried forward to receive his caress.</p>
<p>It was not withheld, the bulky brute cavorting and tumbling
about his master, with the playful affection of a kitten.
It took fully a half-hour before he could be quieted down into
any thing like tractability, during all of which Harry was
sound asleep, and happily unconscious of what was going on
so near him.</p>
<p>It was the wish of the bear-tamer to prevent the lad from
being awakened, and when he had shown the bear where he
was, and permitted him to nose around for a short time, he
concluded that the danger was past, and impressing upon the
sagacious brute the importance of remaining where he was,
he returned to his reconnoissance of the camp.</p>
<p>Here another surprise and a bitter disappointment awaited
him. The huge fire was burning as brightly as ever, but not
an Indian was to be seen!</p>
<p>As silently as shadows, they had launched their canoes
again, and floated away in the gloom of the night!</p>
<p>And so abruptly had all this been done, that Old Ruff had
no suspicion until he saw the evidence before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in his anger. &ldquo;Maquesa is
sharp-witted, and if he&rsquo;d been a fool, he&rsquo;d knowed what the
sign of Speckled Beauty was. He has tramped a good many
miles of the woods alone, but I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s been see&rsquo;d
by any one who knows him, that they haven&rsquo;t made up thar
minds that I was close by. That&rsquo;s jist what the chief has
understood, and he and his varmints has slipped off ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood a moment, fairly gnashing his teeth in his chagrin,
and feeling any thing but particularly friendly toward
the bear that had been the cause of the mishap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confound him!&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I wish that that Yankee
that dyed him up, had made him die himself or had took him
along with him; fur Maquesa isn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be cotched nappin&rsquo;
ag&rsquo;in. Howsomever, if rowin&rsquo;s the word, I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roused to action, he strode rapidly back to where the canoe
was concealed, and pulling it from its concealment, seated
himself in it, and shoved out from shore, paying no heed to
Speckled Beauty, who lingered on shore, expecting an affectionate
farewell.</p>
<p>Reaching the center of the current, he permitted his boat
to float with it for a short time, while he listened.</p>
<p>No sound of paddling reached his ear&mdash;naught but the soft
flow of the river, and the soughing of the night-wind.</p>
<p>But for all that he knew the Blackfeet were paddling
swiftly down the river. They were simply using due caution
in the handling of their paddles, so as not to afford <i>him</i> the
clew that had already guided him so far.</p>
<p>When he resumed the use of the paddle, the impetus of the
boat aroused Harry, who, rousing up, looked around for a moment
in bewilderment. Then, recalling his situation, he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddling yet, Uncle Ruff. It was last night, it seems to
me, that I went asleep, so that you must have kept it up for
twenty-four hours. Don&rsquo;t you feel a little stiff in the
joints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I would if I had been paddling as long as all
that, but I think you&rsquo;re a little ahead of the right number&mdash;say
an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the Indians? What about Little Rifle?
Have you seen nothing of her? Have we lost all trace of
Maquesa and his men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the trapper proceeded to tell, in his characteristic
manner, all that had happened since his young friend had
closed his eyes in slumber.</p>
<p>As may be supposed, Harry listened with the most absorbing
interest. It was aggravating to reflect that they had been
thus nigh Little Rifle, without opening any communication,
and with the only result of placing matters in a much more
favorable light than before; but such was the irresistible fact.</p>
<p>All this time the man was busy at the paddle, occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
pausing to tell whether he could catch any sound from those
ahead, but failing as yet to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How easy it would be for them to land,&rdquo; said Harry, in
a cautious voice, &ldquo;and allow us to pass them in the gloom,
and so get entirely off the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could do it, I allow,&rdquo; replied the hunter, &ldquo;but they
won&rsquo;t. Maquesa is aiming for t&rsquo;other side the mountains,
whar his village is, and he won&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;g&rsquo;in, for any time, till
he gets thar, as he thinks he&rsquo;s got a sure thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the confident tone of the trapper, it began
to look as if the supposition made by the lad was correct;
for as the night passed, not the slightest sound of paddles in
front or rear could be heard. The rising of the moon made
the course of the river visible for a greater distance, but the
eye roamed along the stream and bank in vain.</p>
<p>All night long old Robsart continued at work with the paddle,
passing from side to side, halting, listening and watching,
and Harry assisted him to the best of his ability, but it resulted
in naught.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THROUGH THE CASCADE RANGE.</h2>
<p>The scene now changes to the western slope of the Cascade
Range.</p>
<p>The spot is hundreds of miles from where we last saw Old
Ruff Robsart and Harry Northend. Long days and nights
have passed since then, and during that time these two, who
have become deeply attached to each other, have followed the
river to its kenyon in the mountains, and taking advantage of
a pass well known to the trapper, they have safely worked
their way through the immense snowy chain, and are now
upon the western slope, facing the Pacific.</p>
<p>It was a daring feat for these two to attempt, and many a
time and oft they have been in the most imminent peril of
their lives. Snow, biting arctic winds, fierce Indians, savage
wild beasts and hunger&mdash;these were the enemies that man
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
and boy were compelled to encounter again and again, and
only the matchless skill of the great bear-tamer, his coolness
and self-possession under all circumstances, his wonderful
knowledge of the mountain solitudes and fastnesses, and the
superb physical condition of both, enabled them to come forth
from this tremendous labyrinth of snow-crowned peaks, roaring
kenyons, dizzying ravines, gorges and chasms, not merely
in as good condition as they entered, but (notably in the case
of the lad) stronger, more rugged and better prepared to face
the remaining difficulties to be overcome.</p>
<p>Although, as we have stated above, many days have passed
since Maquesa and his little party gave them the slip on the
river, yet despite the most determined exertions upon the part
of the trapper, the trail had never been recovered.</p>
<p>Maquesa was one of the most cunning of a proverbially
cunning race, and the lesson taught him by the sudden appearance
of the mottled grizzly had not been taught in vain.
He knew at once that his old adversary and friend was after
him and his charge, and he &ldquo;sloped&rdquo; in such a decidedly
French style that his pursuer with all his remarkable skill
had not again caught sight or sound of him.</p>
<p>Finding that the trail was irrecoverably lost, the trapper
gave up the attempt entirely, and believing that Maquesa&rsquo;s
ultimate destination was a village upon the other side of the
Cascade, he made his way through by the shortest and most
expeditious route, intending, if possible, to head him off.</p>
<p>That curiously colored bear seemed to have given up as
hopeless the attempt to keep up with the two, as they slowly
worked their way through the vast mountain-chain, and he
had not been seen since their encampment several nights before
in the pass.</p>
<p>Harry was alone in a glen where he had kindled a fire
secure from the observation of any and all who did not pass
too close. He had learned a great deal since he and his
friend had left the river, and there was little danger of his
committing the rash mistake that had marked his first essay
in hunting a party of Blackfeet Indians.</p>
<p>Old Robsart carefully noted the rapid improvement of the
lad, and he had come to trust him far more than he would
have done a week before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Harry was sitting alone with his blanket thrown over his
shoulders, for there was a chilliness in the air that seemed to
come from the snowy mountains on the east. His rifle was
between his knees, and he sat upon a bowlder looking down
in the embers, thinking and speculating upon the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are on the other side of the mountains from Fort
Abercombie,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and who shall tell whether we
are ever to see Little Rifle again. Old Ruff seems to lose no
heart, and yet he is silent and thoughtful, and I think he must
feel at times as though all hope was about over. He has
taken the telescope and gone off to hunt a Blackfoot village.
I went yesterday with him to find the village where Maquesa
reigned a few years ago; and when we got there, not a sign
of a lodge was to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the fact. Confident of discovering the chief, the
trapper in company with the lad had made his way directly
to the spot where he and a portion of his people had had their
homes for years; but only to find, that, like the Bedouins of
the desert, that they had departed&mdash;months before&mdash;no one
could tell, and there was no means of learning, whither.</p>
<p>This was a damper, and for a time he was completely nonplused.
But, declaring his belief that the village was somewhere
in the neighborhood, he had returned, and from an elevated
point, carefully surveyed the vast area that was spread
before him toward the Pacific.</p>
<p>Finally he had detected the appearance of an Indian town
many miles to the west and south; and, as Harry had been
constantly on the watch and tramp for several days, it was
arranged that he should go into camp in a secure spot and
await the return of the trapper, who expected to put his own
powers of endurance to the severest test.</p>
<p>He had no misgivings in doing this, as there were no signs
of the immediate presence of Indians, and, as for wild animals,
they were to be met with at all times, and he had an
abundance of ammunition, with which to defend himself.</p>
<p>Harry was also furnished with enough meat, cooked and
prepared, to last several days&mdash;it having been their prudent
custom, when among the mountains, to guard against any emergency
in the way of food, by carrying at all times a supply
with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The lad had secured a comfortable little nook in which the
fire was kindled, and had gathered enough fuel, as he supposed,
to last until daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he continued, as he sat gazing absently into
the fire, &ldquo;that Robsart makes no explanation of the reason
why Little Rifle deserted me on that night. I shall never ask
him again if I never learn; I have puzzled my brains over it
a hundred times, but all to no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, if he fails to find Maquesa, what is to be done?
Among these thousands of miles of wilderness, ten thousand
Blackfeet may hide for their lifetime, and no one can find
them. But for that mishap of the bear, it might have been
ended long ago. Now the chief has been warned of what is
afoot, and he is too sharp to be caught&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly in his meditations, as he heard the
sound of something moving near him, and looking up, caught
the outlines of some huge dark animal as it moved back out
of the range of the fire.</p>
<p>There was nothing particularly alarming in this, as he had
become accustomed to such creatures; but, as he sat alone,
miles from any friend, in a mournful reverie, it was a rather
startling awaking, and he caught up and cocked his rifle, as
though he expected a charge from it.</p>
<p>His second thought was that it was &ldquo;Speckled Beauty,&rdquo;
still faithful to his friends; but the action of the brute proved
the contrary, as he remained in the background.</p>
<p>Harry caught the phosphorescent glare of his eyes, and
heard a deep, guttural growl, which proved that if he belonged
to the bear species, he was not the one which had been so well
trained by Adams, and so skillfully but unprofitably ornamented
by the Yankee speculator.</p>
<p>The young man was somewhat loth to fire his gun, as the
trapper had cautioned him never to do so unless compelled,
as the report was frequently more dangerous to the one discharging
it than the bullet was to the one at whom it was
aimed.</p>
<p>But Harry had to choose between the horns of a dilemma.
If he did not give the brute his quietus, he would probably
prowl around all night and keep him continually on the alert
to save his own life. The probabilities, too, were that additional
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
fuel would be required to keep the fire up to the requisite
point, and in the end he would be obliged to kill the creature
in self-defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such being the case,&rdquo; he concluded, after turning the
matter over in his mind, &ldquo;I may as well dispose of my visitor
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the brute, although he was growling and nosing around
the camp-fire, as though seeking an unguarded point where he
could seize his prey, still remained too much in the background
to afford the fair aim that was desirable.</p>
<p>Now and then the glassy glitter of its eyes could be discerned,
but they flashed in and out of view before a fair aim
could be settled upon, and the boy had no disposition to throw
away a shot.</p>
<p>The agility displayed by the beast, as it appeared here and
there in the gloom, caused Harry more than once to suspect
that it was some other kind of creature than a bear, while its
cat-like stealth of movement made him fearful that it would
make some sudden, treacherous spring that would take him
off his guard.</p>
<p>He sat with his gun at his shoulder, waiting for the coveted
chance, when all at once it advanced into full view, and taking
a quick aim, he fired.</p>
<p>There was a fearful snarling howl, and the brute made a
tremendous bound directly backward in the gloom, that carried
him entirely out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! it&rsquo;s my opinion that that pill will have a good effect
upon your system,&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, as he proceeded to
reload his piece. &ldquo;I think it struck you somewhere about the
head, and will make it ache, to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He confidently expected to hear it roll over on the ground,
clawing and clutching the earth in its death-struggles; but
the howl and leap were succeeded by a profound silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has subsided without making any extra fuss,&rdquo; was his
conclusion, as he placed the cap upon the tube of his gun.
&ldquo;That is, perhaps, the plan most to be commended, for he
might have rolled over in the fire and burned himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soft, stealthy movement just then caught the listening
ear of Harry, and turning his gaze as quick as thought to the
opposite side of the fire, he saw, to his amazement, the beast
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
that he had just pronounced dead, stealing toward him on its
belly.</p>
<p>The sight that met the eye of the young adventurer was
enough to startle a man of stronger nerve. The animal was
as black as midnight, quite large, with a long neck, and a snout
that resembled that of a wolf or fox, only much larger and
fiercer. Stretched out, as it stole along in the manner mentioned,
it seemed unnaturally prolonged, while the almond-shaped
eyes seemed to emit fire, as they were fixed with the
most deadly intent upon the one who had already lodged a
bullet in its body.</p>
<p>This horrid head and front were covered with blood, that
trickled upon the ground, showing that if the shot had not
killed, it had certainly inflicted a grievous wound. To what
species the animal belonged, it was impossible to say; but
most probably it was a cross of some kind, combining in itself
the activity and fierceness of the panther, and the treacherous
cunning of the wolf.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it was bent upon the life of the boy, and
would have had it in another moment but for its soft, gliding
movement over the ground, which providentially revealed its
approach before its sharp claws could be buried in his body.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />A BRUTE&rsquo;S SACRIFICE.</h2>
<p>This sudden and unexpected appearance of the wild beast
caused Harry to fire without taking the careful aim that he
would have done had the case been different; but he made
sure that his rifle was pointed straight at the brute, and that
the discharged bullet would be certain to enter his body.</p>
<p>And so it did, but missing the head, buried itself in the
flesh somewhere along the back, the result being another serious
wound and the maddening of the wild animal to such
a degree that he became perfectly frantic in his rage.</p>
<p>Forgetting his habitual cunning and treachery, he rose to
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
his feet, giving utterance to a savage growl, and with his head
lowered, like a bull when about to use his horns, he advanced
directly upon the lad.</p>
<p>The latter had no time to reload, and reading the deadly
intent of his foe, he ran round to the opposite side of the fire,
so as to interpose it between them. The brute, still glaring
and growling, trotted after him.</p>
<p>It would not venture through the fire; but as it was more
nimble of foot than the lad, he could gain nothing by this
course.</p>
<p>Still, as it seemed to be the only thing that he could do,
Harry threw down his gun and snatched up his blanket, and
made a dash for liberty. His hope lay in the belief that the
brute was so badly injured that he would soon become disabled,
and that he would not venture as near the blaze as did
his intended victim.</p>
<p>Disappointed in both of these respects, Harry made a hasty
grab and caught up one of the burning embers of wood, which,
as he walked backward, he whirled about his head as a guard
to keep the brute away.</p>
<p>This was a partial success, as all animals naturally have a
terror of fire, and the one in question fell back growling and
glaring, as if deliberating with himself as to the best method
of circumventing this obstacle.</p>
<p>He showed no disposition to give up his scheme, but continued
stealing forward inch by inch, as a cat is sometimes
seen to do when about to leap upon its prey. Harry halted,
expecting, of course, it would do the same. For a moment
he thought it had, but, as he fixed his eyes upon it, he observed
that it was still advancing, almost imperceptibly, but
none the less surely, for all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound him!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry as he became conscious
of this insidious movement. &ldquo;I never heard of such a creature;
if he wants a taste of fire, I&rsquo;ll give it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast was now less than a dozen feet distant, when the
boy took a step toward him and then dashed the blazing brand
full in his face, muttering, as he did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! take that, if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was enough to daze and terrify any thing, and the brute,
with a howl such as he gave when struck by the first bullet,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
recoiled on himself, reared on his hind-legs, and pawed madly
as if to fight off the torch, which had struck his black head,
and then glanced off in the darkness.</p>
<p>This bewilderment lasted but a second or two, when it
moved toward the lad more determinedly than ever. The
latter had made a snatch at a brand, but in his hurry it had
slipped from his hand after he had risen to his feet, and retreated
a step or two.</p>
<p>Before he could recover it, the brute was not only nearer
to him than that, but had actually interposed between him and
the fire!</p>
<p>Thus in a twinkling, as it were, the lad found that he had
been totally disarmed&mdash;not only deprived of the use of his
gun, through the denial of opportunity to reload it, but he was
shut off from his <i>dernier resort</i>&mdash;the chance of using the fire
to fight off the determined advance of his enemy.</p>
<p>Harry had now his blanket thrown over his left arm, and
his hunting-knife at his waist; but he knew that if he was
forced to a hand-to-hand fight with the furious beast, he
would be torn to shreds before he could do any execution with
his weapon. His case looked exceedingly desperate, for the
snarling animal having intruded himself between him and the
fire, was too knowing to permit him to recover his place again.</p>
<p>It was useless to attempt to flee, and Harry Northend stood
his ground, looking down with a fascinated gaze upon the
horrid-looking brute, as creeping along for a foot or two
more, it began gathering its paws beneath its body, to make
its leap.</p>
<p>With a courage born almost of despair, he saw all this and
never stirred, standing like the bird that is charmed by the
rattlesnake, that knows it sees certain death, but has neither
the power nor the will to escape.</p>
<p>But it was not entirely thus with the lad. He possessed
rare courage and pluck, and had decided his own course of
action. It was a desperate resort, but it was all that remained
to him, and he held his nerves with a will of iron until the
critical moment was upon him.</p>
<p>It came with the next breath. There was a sudden quickening
of the legs as they were gathered beneath the belly of
the animal, and then it made its fearful leap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>For one instant the dark, panther-shaped body was visible
in the air, and then, as Harry saw it descending upon him, he
gave the blanket a flirt so as to throw it directly over the head
of the snarling beast, leaping aside at the same instant, and
making another attempt to recover his position by the fire.</p>
<p>He succeeded in doing this, although he fell upon his hands
and knees, and before he could scramble to his feet again, the
brute had pawed the blanket from his eyes, and glancing
around for an instant, discovered where his slippery victim
was.</p>
<p>There can be but little doubt of the ultimate result of this
strange contest, for every advantage was upon the side of the
beast, which gave no evidence of suffering the least exhaustion
from the wounds it had received.</p>
<p>But at this critical juncture a third party appeared upon
the scene, not in the shape of Old Ruff or an Indian, but in
that of another wild brute.</p>
<p>As Harry rose to his feet, torch in hand, and stood confronting
his enemy, he heard a growl from his right hand,
and concluded that it was all over with him beyond a question,
if he was to be called upon to combat two such enemies.</p>
<p>The wounded animal heard the ominous sound, and also
turned his head, sending back a defiant growl, as if to warn
all outside parties that there was to be no interference here.</p>
<p>The thunderous growl was still rumbling in the throat of
the brute when Harry saw a huge dark body pass like an arrow
through the air, coming down from the rock over his
head, and speeding as straight and truly as if fired from the
mouth of a giant columbiad, directly at the defiant beast, which
was not given time to prepare for the charge.</p>
<p>The attacking brute landed directly upon the shoulder of
the other, and at the same instant the two closed in a deadly,
fearful encounter.</p>
<p>With the quickness of lightning the fight assumed the fiercest
character, the two wild beasts going at each other with
the determination to do or die. Snarling, growling, clawing,
scratching, gouging, biting, snapping, tearing and rending,
they rolled over and over upon the ground, the hair flying in
every direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Harry Northend stood transfixed, for the time, by the terrible
scene before him. The fight was of that furious nature
which showed that it would never terminate until one or both
were dead, and that the consummation was sure to take place
very speedily.</p>
<p>And reflecting that whichever party was the victor would
be certain to turn upon him, the young hunter was too prudent
to throw away the opportunity thus providentially placed
in his hands, and he hurriedly caught up his rifle and began
reloading it, with the intention of taking a position from which
he could watch the fight, and when it should terminate, could
lodge a bullet in the brain of the victor and leave himself
master of the situation.</p>
<p>The act of loading his weapon naturally drew away his attention
from the combatants for the time; but when he had
placed the percussion upon the tube, he turned his gaze upon
the struggling beasts again.</p>
<p>Just then they rolled closer to the fire than they were
before, and were consequently brought into closer view, and
as the lad withdrew from beyond their reach, and looked
down upon them, he saw, with feelings that may be imagined,
that the one making the attack was his old friend and acquaintance,
&ldquo;Speckled Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One look at his hide, now crimsoned with a deeper dye
than the art of the showman could give it, showed this, and
the whilom resentment that he had felt for the mishap caused
by him, was now turned to gratitude and admiration for the
part he was playing in his defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight away, my friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Neither Old
Ruff nor I shall ever say or think ill of you again, for you
meant well, and but for your coming now, I should have been
in your place. Good luck to you, and I will give you what
help I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His purpose now was to lodge another bullet in the other
beast in such a way as to &ldquo;lay him out,&rdquo; and leave Speckled
Beauty the master, for it looked as if he had undertaken a
job which he was unable to carry through, his foe showing
not only the greatest tenacity of life, but also displaying a
strength and activity almost incredible.</p>
<p>The mottled bear possessed enormous strength, but in quickness
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
of movement he was far inferior to his foe, whose long,
sharp claws, were tearing and pounding at his vitals with
blows like the piston-rod of a steam engine; but the Beauty
was game, and he stuck to his antagonist to the last, never intending
to give up the fight so long as the strength remained
to continue it.</p>
<p>Harry held his rifle cocked for several minutes, waiting and
unable to get the chance to fire; for the two rolled over so
rapidly&mdash;first one under and then on top again, that he was
fearful he might wound his friend instead of his enemy.</p>
<p>Leaping back and forth around the two dark bodies, now
upon one side and then upon the other, and once or twice
narrowly escaping being thrown beneath them, with the blood
and hair flying all over his clothes&mdash;Harry at last saw his
chance.</p>
<p>There was a momentary lull in the fight, the bear was under,
and the head of the other was in full view. Quick as
thought the muzzle of the rifle was thrust into his ear, and
the trigger pulled.</p>
<p>The shot told, and the bullet went crashing and tearing
through the skull and brain of the beast, who lay motionless
for a moment, and then with a spasmodic quiver rolled over
upon the ground without a spark of life in his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, brave friend,&rdquo; said Harry, bending over the
grizzly bear, &ldquo;you have done me a service for which I can
never pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped lower and looked more closely at him. The animal
never stirred. A groan of anguish escaped him, and it
was his last. Speckled Beauty was as dead as his foe!</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />UNWELCOME VISITORS.</h2>
<p>As Harry looked upon the dead body of his brute friend, he
could but feel saddened and pitiful. It had followed him
and Robsart for hundreds of miles, in obedience to that emotion
of affection, which is a characteristic of the entire animal
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
creation, and now it had given up its life to save him, who
for days past had felt little but resentment toward it, for the
mistake it had unwittingly made.</p>
<p>But little time was given the lad for indulgence in the finer
emotions of his nature; for, while he stood leaning on his
rifle, and looking down upon the mangled carcass, his ear,
trained to unusual acuteness, detected the approach of something
else, and he immediately raised his weapon and stood
on the defensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of those brutes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but there is no
Speckled Beauty to help me this time, and I can not throw
away a shot&mdash; Helloa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well might he start with alarm, for just then the figure of
an Indian warrior came out of the gloom, and walked directly
toward him. Harry turned his head to see what chance there
was to dart back in the darkness upon that side, but only to
encounter two other red-skins fully as near as the first!</p>
<p>He felt that he was fairly caught, and he could do nothing
but submit to the inevitable with the best grace possible under
the circumstances.</p>
<p>The two red-skins halted but a few feet distant, and remained
standing and motionless, as if to shut off any attempt
to escape, while they left to the third the part of chief actor
and spokesman in the business.</p>
<p>As Harry turned again and looked fully in the face of the
latter, it struck him that he had seen him before. He was
tall and well-formed, with a gaudily-colored blanket covering
his shoulders, and which thrown partly back from his front,
showed a large hunting knife at his girdle. In his left hand
he carried a rifle, while the right left free was extended in
greeting toward the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you do, white pappoose?&rdquo; he asked with a grim
smile, and a perfection of accent that amazed the boy.</p>
<p>The latter could do nothing less than accept the proffered
hand, although he did so with no little misgiving, fearing that
it was only a prelude to some treachery upon his part.</p>
<p>But the Indian relinquished it the next moment, and then
seemed disposed to act the part of an attorney conducting a
cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you come from?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;From the fort, the other side of the mountains,&rdquo; replied
the boy, extending his hand toward the north-east in which
direction the frontier post lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come all alone&mdash;come away here&mdash;nobody with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is with me now excepting you and your warriors,&rdquo;
said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come alone&mdash;who bring white pappoose from fort,
away &rsquo;cross mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great hunter has been my guide and companion all
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad hesitated a moment, not knowing whether it was
prudent or not to use deception under the circumstances, but
his questioner manifested some impatience at the attempt already
made to parry his queries, and he concluded it best to
reply truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is known as Old Ruff the mountaineer, although he
has been more in the trapping business lately; there lies one
of the animals that he tamed to be his dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He noticed a slight manifestation of surprise upon the part
of the Indian as he made this reply, and just then the impression
came with renewed force that he had seen him before.
Where could it be? Ah! now he recalled. He was one of
the Blackfeet that he and Old Ruff had seen in the canoe,
when scrutinizing Little Rifle through the field-glass.</p>
<p><i>Could it be Maquesa?</i> was the next question that came to
the mind of Harry, when he took occasion at the same instant
to throw a sidelong glance at the other two, in the hope that
possibly he could recognize one of them as the chief.</p>
<p>But the scrutiny through the glass had not been complete
enough to enable him to do this. He believed that all three
of his visitors had been in the canoes at that time, but whether
either of them was the Blackfoot for whom he and the old
hunter had been so persistently searching for many days, and
for whom the trapper was hunting this very moment, whether
he was one of the three, he could only conjecture.</p>
<p>When the red-skin received the reply recorded, he was silent
a moment or two, looking sharply down in the face of
the boy, who felt somewhat embarrassed by the keen scrutiny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where he be now?&rdquo; he asked, lowering his voice, but
keeping his eyes fixed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone&mdash;he went away to-day&mdash;he is down yonder at
the foot of the mountain somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he go&mdash;why he leave white pappoose all alone for
big bear to eat him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry became uneasy under these pointed questions&mdash;the
object of which he could not divine. He was unwilling to be
more explicit in his replies, until he could be certain of what
the result of such a revelation was likely to be. So he rather
ingeniously took up the appellation the Indian had applied to
him, resenting it with an assumption of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me a pappoose?&rdquo; he demanded, straightening
up. &ldquo;I am no more a babe than are your warriors. I
am a hunter and a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This grandiloquent reply caused a very perceptible grin
upon the faces of all three Blackfeet, who seemed to admire
the spirit of the lad; but it did not divert the leader from the
&ldquo;line&rdquo; of questioning which he had laid out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where old hunter go&mdash;why he leave little brave white
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone off on a hunt, and when he gets through, I
suppose he will return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a reply as this, it would seem, ought to have satisfied
any ordinary mortal, and it would have done so, but for the
fact that the red-skin was unquestionably upon the scent of
something, and most probably knew a great deal more than
he pretended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he look for&mdash;big bear or big Injin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is looking for Maquesa, the great Blackfoot chief,&rdquo;
replied Harry, feeling there was no avoiding the issue;
&ldquo;he and I have been hunting for him for weeks, but have not
been able to see him. Old Ruff thought to find him in his
village, where he met him a long time ago, but the village is
gone, and he knows not where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he look for big Injin chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he stole Little Rifle, and has run away with him,&rdquo;
answered Harry, purposely using the masculine reference.</p>
<p>At this the Indian flared up, and replied in a quick, angry
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;You lie! Ruff steal pappoose from Maquesa&mdash;Maquesa
take pappoose back from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That solved the question that had been puzzling Harry during
the last few minutes. He knew now that he was talking
to Maquesa himself.</p>
<p>After following him for days and weeks in vain, and when
about ready to give up the search as hopeless, the chief had
come forward from his hiding-place and shown himself.</p>
<p>The lad still felt himself in a dangerously delicate position,
and he never longed so much for the presence of Old Ruff as
he did now that he had discovered the identity of his interlocutor.</p>
<p>What was the object of these three men coming from the
gloom and surrounding him in the manner that they had done?
What did Maquesa mean by questioning him so closely? And
what was their purpose regarding the boy whom they had so
completely in their power?</p>
<p>These were the questions which the lad put to himself, and
whose answers caused him no little trouble and anxiety.</p>
<p>Maquesa, upon making the foregoing reply, gave some signal
to the other warriors, and all three seated themselves upon
the ground, as if they had concluded to spend the night with
him. Without waiting for an invitation, Harry followed suit,
and he played the part of a host by drawing the cooked meat
from beneath the stone, where he had hid it from prying animals,
and offering it to his guests. But all declined accepting
it, and he placed it back again.</p>
<p>As the chief remained silent for some time, Harry concluded
to put some questions to him, on his own account, hoping to
gain a little information, but somewhat distrustful of the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Ruff found Little Rifle asleep, and no one was near;
he thought the pappoose would die, and he brought it away
to save its life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Ruff tell big lie! Pappoose in lodge&mdash;Maquesa close
by&mdash;he come back, no find pappoose; get mad&mdash;burn down
his lodge, and den go &rsquo;way. One, two, t&rsquo;ree, good many
moons, and he neber see her&mdash;t&rsquo;ink she dead; den he hear
Old Hunter hab Little Rifle&mdash;Maquesa t&rsquo;ink <i>him</i> de squaw
pappoose, and he come ober mountain arter her&mdash;she go &rsquo;way
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
wid him&mdash;Old Hunter try catch &rsquo;em, but he paddle too slow&mdash;can&rsquo;t
find Little Rifle&mdash;and <i>neber see her again</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe the intensity of interest
with which Harry Northend listened to these broken utterances
of the chief, and the closing declaration that Little Rifle
would never be seen again brought him to his feet in the
greatest excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that Little Rifle will never be seen
again? What have you done with her? Is she dead?
What has become of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maquesa and the other Indians looked quietly at the excited
lad, as if rather amused than otherwise at his flurry; but the
chief showed no disposition to be as explicit in his replies as
Harry himself had been. It was not until the question had
been repeated that he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Rifle gone&mdash;Old Hunter and white pappoose neber
see her &rsquo;gin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Harry Northend been certain that Maquesa had been
the cause of the girl&rsquo;s death, he would have sprung upon him
as the mottled bear sprung upon the savage beast; but, by
this time, he had managed to think a little, and his own common
sense taught him that it was extremely improbable that
the Blackfoot had done her any personal harm. Her history,
as revealed by the slip of paper, pointed to a different conclusion
altogether.</p>
<p>It was useless to attempt to question Maquesa, when he was
not disposed to reply; but Harry took a different course, in
the hope of reaching the truth in another way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hunt for Big Hunter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wily Blackfoot was fully authorized to grin, as he did,
when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Maquesa look for Big Hunter, <i>Maquesa can find
him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy recalled the mystery which had puzzled
him so long, and it seemed to him that the means of solving
it might be now placed in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me, Maquesa, why it was that Little Rifle
left me, as she did, and went away with you? You did
not steal her, and why should she go without awaking from
her sleep and saying good-by to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The chief was about to answer this query fully and explicitly
(a half-dozen words would have done it), when perverse
fate interfered and closed his mouth again, with the all-important
words upon his very tongue.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE REVELATION OF MAQUESA.</h2>
<p>The interference, this time, came in the shape of Old Ruff
Robsart himself, who strode forward out of the gloom, and
advancing straight to the chief, extended his hand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Maquesa? I have been huntin&rsquo; fur yer
for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Blackfoot returned the salutation with every appearance
of cordiality, much to the surprise of the other two red-skins,
who were hardly prepared for the exhibition of any
thing like friendship between a white man and one of their
race.</p>
<p>Having paid his respects to him, the trapper turned to his
young friend with one of his huge grins, that moved his beard
clean back to his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you war lookin&rsquo; fur me; but the way on it
was&mdash;while I was huntin&rsquo; round fur that Injin village that
had strayed off somewhar and got lost, I found thar was a little
clump of lodges closer by, and I made up my mind to pay
them a visit fust. Wal, I was trampin&rsquo; &rsquo;long when I heard
your gun go off, and purty soon I heard it go agin, and then
I knowed you war in some row, so I struck a bee-line fur you,
and here I is. Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed, noticing the bodies of
the two wild animals for the first time, &ldquo;that war the trouble,
eh? And as sure as I&rsquo;m alive, thar&rsquo;s old Speckled Beauty
gone under at last. Tell me how it all came about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Blackfeet showed no disposition to interfere, or prevent
this conversation, Harry related, as briefly as possible
what the reader has already learned of his adventure with the
strange animal, from whose clutches he was hardly saved by
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
the timely coming to his assistance of the tame grizzly
bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always war a plucky critter,&rdquo; said the mountaineer,
when the recital was finished, and speaking us though he had
no particular regrets at his death; &ldquo;I thought that ever since
the time when he war a cub, and come mighty near chawin&rsquo;
me up; but what sort of critter was it that he lit on?&rdquo; he
asked, as he walked forward to examine it.</p>
<p>The trapper poked the carcass with his foot and gun, for
some minutes, stooping down and peering at it with no little
curiosity. Finally he seemed to give up the conundrum as
past his ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Maquesa,&rdquo; said he, turning to the chief, &ldquo;you
was born and raised in the woods. Come and tell me what
sort of a critter this is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Blackfoot thus appealed to walked forward, and made
the same examination as did his white friend, but seemingly
with very little more success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooh!&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;he no bear&mdash;he debbel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he is,&rdquo; was the comment of Old Ruff, as he walked
back and resumed his seat, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know the Old Boy
was killed as easy as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piece of badinage being finished, the party arranged
themselves for more serious business. The two red-skins,
who had acted the part of dummies thus far, lit their pipes
and stretched out in a lazy posture upon the ground, ready
and willing to wait their master&rsquo;s orders, no matter how long
they might be deferred.</p>
<p>Maquesa and Old Ruff seated themselves near each other,
and Harry assumed a position where he could be certain of
hearing every word that passed between them. Great, therefore,
was his disappointment, when they began talking, to
find that it was in the Blackfoot tongue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, desperately, &ldquo;if I had known
that <i>that</i> was the trick they were going to play, I would have
learned the gibberish myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there seemed to be no help for it, and he concluded to
take the matter philosophically. So he gathered his blanket
about him, and, nestling down by the rocks, went to sleep.</p>
<p>It was well he did so, for thereby he escaped a weary
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
waiting. Maquesa and Robsart must have entered into the
discussion of political questions, for, although it was not very
late in the evening when they began, yet they never finished
until nearly daylight.</p>
<p>Finally there seemed to be no more for either to say, and
the Blackfoot rose, shook the hand of the trapper, in token
of amity, and then speaking to his warriors, they too arose, and
the three moved off in the gloom and were seen no more.</p>
<p>The fire had burned very low, the two speakers paying no
heed to it in the earnestness of their conversation. The old
hunter cast on a few more sticks, and then rising and yawning
he looked off at the sky.</p>
<p>It was still dark, but in the east were signs of the coming
sun. His experienced eye told him that day was close at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skulp me!&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;ef I thought our confab had
lasted as long as that. Thar&rsquo;s the younker curled up and
snoozin&rsquo; like a sensible chap. I seen him curl down here
thinkin&rsquo; he was goin&rsquo; to hear every word and l&rsquo;arn a good
deal; but I nipped that by opening the ball in Blackfoot rigmarole,
&rsquo;cause I knowed thar war some things which it
wouldn&rsquo;t do fur him to hear just yit. He&rsquo;ll l&rsquo;arn it all in good
time, and bein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s so late I guess thar ain&rsquo;t no use in my
layin&rsquo; down. I grabbed a couple of salmon out of an eddy
in the water, down yender, and dressed &rsquo;em, and laid &rsquo;em
away &rsquo;mong the leaves, &rsquo;cause thar wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;nough for these
red varmints, and they kin catch thar fish as well as me. I&rsquo;ll
get &rsquo;em and cook &rsquo;em for breakfast, and I guess when they
begin to smoke and fry, and he gets a sniff, he&rsquo;ll wake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared for a short time, and when he returned he
carried two large spotted fish in his hand. They were plump
and luscious, and all prepared for the coals.</p>
<p>The fire, having been burning and smoldering for so many
hours, was in the best condition possible. The coals were
raked out into a glowing bed, free from dirt and ashes, and
the two fish laid thereon.</p>
<p>Instantly scorching crisp, they gave out a smoke and savor
enough to drive a hungry person frantic. The trapper carefully
watched and turned them for several minutes, by which
time they were thoroughly prepared for the palate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>By this time it was fairly light, and Harry not having
awaked, Old Ruff having lifted one of the hot, smoking fish
upon some fresh green leaves, and, kneeling softly beside the
lad, held the morsel so that the odor was sure to reach the
nostrils.</p>
<p>One good sniff was enough. The boy moved uneasily,
flung the blanket from his shoulders, opened his eyes, and
called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! give me something to eat before I starve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you shall have it,&rdquo; replied Old Ruff, &ldquo;only sit
up like a Christian and eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes sufficed to make matters clear, and as Harry
began to eat the tempting fish he looked around for the Blackfeet,
and seeing them not, made inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere Maquesa is the cunningest varmint I ever run
afoul of,&rdquo; said the trapper, after answering the question; &ldquo;of
course he knowed that I was arter him, ever since that night
Speckled Beauty walked into camp and told him so. He
never stopped to see me, but he just tramped ahead, and arter
fixing things to suit him, he then turned &rsquo;bout to meet
me. He must have seen us when I left you yesterday,
and, waitin&rsquo; till I had got out of sight, he went in to plague
you a little, for the old greaser ain&rsquo;t above a joke now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he showed no disposition to hurt me,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I come up in time to sp&rsquo;ile thar game, but ef I&rsquo;d
stayed away a couple of hours longer they&rsquo;d put you through
a course of sprouts, and made you b&rsquo;l&rsquo;eve sartin you war goin&rsquo;
to be skulped and burnt at the stake. That was all them varmints
come fur&mdash;just for the sake of having a little fun out
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m very glad you put in an appearance when you
did, for I don&rsquo;t fancy these red-skins, and I don&rsquo;t understand
all the little tricks they&rsquo;re up to. If they had begun that
business I&rsquo;d been certain they were in dead earnest, and
would have done my best to use my gun or rifle upon them,
and then I suppose the fun would have turned to dead earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may bet on that; <i>that</i> ain&rsquo;t the kind of fun they
fancy, and them other two chaps with him are a couple of
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
bloody dogs that would have been glad of the chance to split
your head open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Little Rifle?&rdquo; asked Harry, unable longer
to conceal his impatience. &ldquo;I noticed that you talked Indian,
so you must have given Maquesa a chance to do most of
the talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks English purty well, but of course it ain&rsquo;t like
his own woshy-boshy, so I steered ahead in <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mighty strange story that he told,&rdquo; said the trapper,
seriously, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; more nor less than this.
He said that a couple of moons ago, he l&rsquo;arned that the
little gal that had been left in his charge was the Little
Rifle that I had, and so he came across the mountains arter
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it that he found out?&rdquo; asked Harry. &ldquo;Who
could have told him the secret, when, at that time, even you
and Little Rifle herself did not know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question I put to him, and he wouldn&rsquo;t answer,
but I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;l&rsquo;eve any one told him, but that he thought
it out for himself. Of course it took him a long time, for he
has known for a good many years that Little Rifle has been
with me, but the old chap has got brains enough to cipher
out a thing like that, without any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does his story correspond with that told by the slip
of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Zactly; he says the babe was left in his charge by a great
white man, who thought all the world of him, and that he
seen him write something on a slip of paper, and put it in
the handle of the gun. He and his squaw took it to their
lodge on the other side the mountains, and war keepin&rsquo; it
thar. They often left it alone, and it happened at one of
these times that I slipped in and went away with it, and I&rsquo;ve
had it ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was Maquesa who succeeded in getting her away
from us. Did he tell you why it was that she came to leave
me so willingly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he didn&rsquo;t tell me that, &rsquo;cause thar warn&rsquo;t no need of
it. I knowed it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry had hoped to catch the trapper off his guard, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
secure the coveted answer, but Robsart saw through the
trick in time to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is he doing with Little Rifle? Why does he
keep her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he hasn&rsquo;t got her at all&mdash;that he hasn&rsquo;t seen her
for several days&mdash;and that he never expects to see her again.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />COUNTERPLOTTING.</h2>
<p>Harry Northend sat astounded and stupefied at the answer
of Old Ruff, and when he had partly regained his self-poise
he repeated the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maquesa says he has not seen her for several days, and
never expects to see her again. Is that what the chief
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s almost his words &rsquo;zactly&mdash;leastways, that&rsquo;s &rsquo;zactly
what he meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, what does he mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that he has met the father of Little Rifle&mdash;that
he met him a couple of weeks ago, and that it was on his account
he came through the mountains arter her. Her father
waited somewhere for him&mdash;down toward the Willamette, I
b&rsquo;l&rsquo;eve, at one of the forts. Thar Maquesa met him, and thar
he turned over Little Rifle to him, and both have started for
Astoria, whar they&rsquo;re going to take ship for San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a revelation indeed, and for several minutes
Harry sat with open mouth, hardly able to realize all that
had been said. Before he could make any comment the trapper
added, in a significant tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big story to tell, and it may all be true, but somehow
or other I think old Maquesa was lying to me, and tryin&rsquo;
to throw me off the right track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you suspect, Uncle Ruff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I kin tell &rsquo;zactly,&rdquo; he answered, with a
puzzled air as he scratched his head, &ldquo;but he let drop one
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
or two things that made me think he was very anxious to get
you and me off to Astoria, where we&rsquo;d be out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, then, that that part of his story was a fabrication?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t believe Little Rifle has started for Astoria;
but thar&rsquo;s some truth, too, in what the varmint said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to tell; but I s&rsquo;pect he has met the father of
Little Rifle, or else, when he went away a good many years
ago, the man promised to come back ag&rsquo;in, and the time being
&rsquo;bout up, Maquesa has started off to hunt up his little gal for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not seem probable to me,&rdquo; said Harry, after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;No man would go away or remain away
voluntarily for years, knowing that his only daughter was
among a tribe of barbarous savages. No father could willingly
leave a child to grow up among them, as your theory
would make Mr. Ravenna do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied the trapper. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
of all that, but I kin see the reason in it now. It must be,
then, that Maquesa is waiting to see the father, and wishes to
get us out the way until arter he delivers her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems very likely,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;there is reason
and consistency in all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arter he turns the gal over to the father, then I s&rsquo;pose
he don&rsquo;t care, and we kin tramp and hunt all we&rsquo;re a
mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he wish us to go to Astoria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar ar&rsquo; ships sailin&rsquo; from thar to Fr&rsquo;isco. The smart
dog thinks when we git thar, that we&rsquo;ll just hear of some vessel
goin&rsquo; down the coast, and will be sartin the father and
gal have gone, and we&rsquo;ll start arter &rsquo;em. That&rsquo;ll put us out
of the way for a couple of months, you see, and that&rsquo;ll give
the old coon plenty time to get through with his part of the
business, and when we come back mad and tearing, what&rsquo;ll he
care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspect, then, that Little Rifle is still in the hands
of Maquesa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think. As long as he was on the go with
her, he didn&rsquo;t mind how hard we follered arter, for he could
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
dodge us all the time; but now he&rsquo;s settled down for a while,
and it&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;bout all his time to watch the gal, without
watchin&rsquo; us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Little Rifle is probably at Maquesa&rsquo;s village close at
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, and of course I&rsquo;m going to find out
afore I make a fair start for Fr&rsquo;isco. I ain&rsquo;t quite &rsquo;nough
fool to start off on such a hunt without something more than
the word of Maquesa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know how cunning he is, Uncle Ruff; he will be
on the watch for us, and it will be hard for you to reconnoiter
the village without his discovering it; and that will show
him that we don&rsquo;t believe what he has told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beat me up to this time,&rdquo; replied the trapper, with
a grin, &ldquo;but if he beats me now, I&rsquo;ll leave the woods and
mountains, and open an oyster saloon in Fr&rsquo;isco. But come!
do you see how high the sun is? Let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry noticed that as they moved away the old man headed
for the Columbia river, which lay off to the south-west,
and to reach which by the present route, would carry them
entirely out of the way of the Indian village in which Maquesa
ruled and reigned.</p>
<p>The trapper explained by saying that his intention was to
&ldquo;fool&rdquo; the chief into the belief that he had given his words
full credence, and was really on his way for the little trading-post
at the head of the Columbia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very kind&mdash;oncommonly so,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;he told
me where I could find one of his canoes, which he said was
a mighty good thing to shoot the Dalles with. We&rsquo;ll take it,
and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps use it for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The river was still a goodly distance away, and it was a
couple of hours before they reached it; but, so explicit had
been the instructions of the Blackfoot, that scarcely fifteen
minutes passed, after striking the stream, before the boat was
found, and the two entered, and headed down-stream, Old
Ruff paddling at a leisurely rate, like one who has a week of
labor ahead.</p>
<p>Not until they had rounded a large bend in the river, did
he make any reference to the Blackfoot who had sent them
upon this errand. Then it was to inquire:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t notice nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;ticular when we shoved off, younker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry replied in the negative, wondering to what he referred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maquesa and another varmint were on t&rsquo;other side the
river, watchin&rsquo;. I seen &rsquo;em, but they didn&rsquo;t know it. You
see, they wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sartin whar I meant to go, and that&rsquo;s what
they war after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are certain they have been deceived as to what
you mean to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t sartin yet, and I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve he is. I&rsquo;m paddlin&rsquo;
mighty slow, as you have obsarved, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m expecting he&rsquo;ll
take another squint. Ef he does, it will be from the top of
that swell yender. He orter reached it by this time, &rsquo;cause
we haven&rsquo;t traveled fast. Jes&rsquo; turn your glass that way&mdash;as
careless, like, you know, as you can&mdash;and see whether you
can catch sight of any top-knots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did as requested, and after a few seconds&rsquo; careful
survey, he declared that he saw nothing suspicious. The
swell alluded to was upon the right bank of the river, rising
to a hight of a dozen feet or so, with no trees, but covered
with long, luxuriant grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take it,&rdquo; said Robsart to Harry, and turning it in
the direction indicated, he held it motionless for considerable
time, leaving the canoe to drift with the current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; of him,&rdquo; he said, still holding the instrument
to his eye; &ldquo;guess he thinks thar ain&rsquo;t no use of his
going to Astoria&mdash; Skulp me! ef I didn&rsquo;t cotch a glimpse of
his top-knot then. He&rsquo;s a-layin&rsquo; flat, and raised his noddle
jist high &rsquo;nough for me to see it through the grass. Now its
down ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times this was repeated, until the trapper, convinced
that he was entirely alone, grew weary, and passing the telescope
to his companion, resumed the paddle.</p>
<p>The Columbia, at this part of its course, was quite broad
and winding, and by keeping close to the shore, Robsart managed
his boat in such a way that, while he appeared to be at
work all the time, he was in reality making little progress;
for, as will be easily seen, every rod thus passed over, very
likely would have to be tramped back, not once but twice again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The experienced eye of the trapper was enabled to discover,
almost to a certainty, the points from which the Blackfoot
chief would make his observations, and after doubling another
cape, he directed the glass to the suspicious point.</p>
<p>But a careful survey, repeated many times, failed to reveal
any thing at all; and the conclusion was inevitable.</p>
<p>Maquesa had been satisfied in his own mind that his statements
were fully credited, and that the two were on their way
to the mouth of the Columbia. Consequently he had withdrawn
from watching and following them.</p>
<p>Another result from all this was the conviction that the
chief had been using deception, and that, in the words of
Harry, they had not only overtaken Little Rifle, but had passed
beyond her, and to find her again, they must turn about and
retrace a goodly part of the distance.</p>
<p>Old Ruff Robsart, understanding the tricky nature of Maquesa
as he did, dared not take any thing for granted, and although
almost positive that he was no longer under surveillance,
he kept up his semblance of journeying westward until
the sun went down, and darkness wrapped the forest and
stream in its sable mantle.</p>
<p>And then, as soon as assured that he was under the scrutiny
of no prowling red-skin, he shot the canoe under the
bank and leaped out.</p>
<p>Every thing had been arranged beforehand, so that no time
was now lost in the exchange of words.</p>
<p>Harry was to remain where he was until his return, no
matter if he was absent a month. This was to be a journey
entirely on foot, and the trapper&rsquo;s legs had enjoyed such a
good rest that they felt capable of almost any thing. A run
of a dozen miles would be no more than enough to give them
a good stretching.</p>
<p>After springing ashore, he merely uttered a word of parting,
and then whisked away like a shadow, leaving Harry
Northend alone.</p>
<p>The latter made up his mind for a good long period of waiting,
so he ran the canoe out a short distance into the stream,
where he made the stern fast to a long, outreaching limb, and
then, wrapping himself up in his blanket, went to sleep.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred to interrupt his sleep, and when he awoke,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
the stream was sparkling in the sunshine, and the cool, fresh
morning air was crinkling the surface.</p>
<p>The next sensation of which he was aware was one of excessive
hunger, and unfastening the boat, he paddled ashore
and sprung out to go on a hunt after something.</p>
<p>Harry drew the canoe up the bank and entirely out of the
water, remembering the caution that the trapper always took
at such a time, not merely from any sudden rising of the current
but to prevent its catching the eye of any foes who might
pass up or down stream.</p>
<p>This done to his own satisfaction, he threw his rifle upon
his shoulder and was just starting off upon his hunt, when the
crackling of a branch told him that some one was approaching!</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />DOWN THE COLUMBIA.</h2>
<p>The next moment the copse parted, and to the surprise and
pleasure of Harry Northend, not an Indian or wild animal,
but old Robsart himself appeared.</p>
<p>The lad was not expecting him before nightfall, but he had
strong hopes that when he did come he would bring Little
Rifle with him; when he saw, therefore, that he was entirely
alone, the pleasure of meeting his old friend again was mingled
with a bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>But the trapper did not appear cast down or discouraged,
although he, too, was apparently disappointed in the result of
his journey.</p>
<p>After grasping the hand of the lad, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose, younker? Arter all I&rsquo;ve said, and
arter all we&rsquo;ve seen, that Maquesa has been tellin&rsquo; me nothin&rsquo;
but the truth itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo; inquired Harry, with no little amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never more in &rsquo;arnest in my life; I got a look into thar
village, and was mighty lucky in finding the lodge of Maquesa
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
himself. Thar I listened fur a half-hour, while he talked with
his squaw, and what I heard him say made me sartin that Little
Rifle has joined her father, and with a couple of Injins to
guide &rsquo;em, they&rsquo;re gone down the Columbia, on thar way to
Fr&rsquo;isco. If we ever expect to overhaul &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s just what
we&rsquo;ve got to do. The little gal is still ahead of us, and we&rsquo;re
a good ways behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have they the start of us?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno; but I think it can&rsquo;t be fur from two days, and
mebbe a good deal more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is any probability of our overtaking
them, before they reach the mouth of the Columbia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are all ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; it; &rsquo;cause it ain&rsquo;t likely that
them two red-skins have slept much on thar way. You know
the old man would be purty sartin to give &rsquo;em good pay and
hurry &rsquo;em up all he could. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they&rsquo;ve
set him and Little Rifle already ashore, and then our only chance
is that the vessel they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; on don&rsquo;t sail afore we git
thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us be off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were so eager to get forward that they took no more
time than was absolutely necessary for taking their dinner.
The day was clear and pleasant, just cool enough to make
the exercise of paddling exhilarating to one of Old Ruff&rsquo;s
powerful, healthy frame.</p>
<p>He worked as untiringly as a steam engine, and aided by
the swift current of the Columbia they made good progress
toward the ocean.</p>
<p>All the way along the river the trapper was on the look-out
for the returning canoe, in which Ravenna and Little
Rifle had been taken to Astoria. Having seen nothing of it
thus far, he had strong hopes of reaching the mouth of the
Columbia so near behind it as to intercept their friends before
they started for San Francisco.</p>
<p>At the same time there was the possibility, if not the probability,
that the returning Blackfeet had either gone back
overland or had avoided them.</p>
<p>The most vivid reminder that they were out of the woods
was the sudden appearance of a sloop coming up-stream. It
was under full sail, and at first sight of it Harry started and
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
exclaimed that they were now indeed in a land of civilization.</p>
<p>The Columbia is ascended by large vessels to Fort Vancouver,
about a hundred miles from the mouth, while vessels
of very light draught now reach a point nearly double that
distance.</p>
<p>A few miles further, and just as the day was drawing to a
close, our friends came in sight of a schooner anchored close
to shore.</p>
<p>Robsart ran the little boat alongside, and finding several
of the crew aboard, made inquiries as to whether they had
noticed a canoe going by at any time during the past few days.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the question the sailors laughed, and declared
that they had seen fully a hundred during the week that they
had been ascending the river; and even when the trapper
explained particularly the number and general appearance of
the occupants of the one he was seeking, the seamen could
give no satisfactory answer, and Old Ruff resumed his journey,
rather ill-naturedly remarking that it was no use of
making inquiries of men who knew nothing and never would
know any thing.</p>
<p>They had come a long distance during the day and the
trapper needed rest. Accordingly the boat was run ashore,
turned over on its face, and they sought and procured lodgings
in a little settlement that stood back a short distance from
the shore.</p>
<p>As may be believed, the sun was scarcely above the horizon
when the canoe was again speeding down the Columbia,
which was rapidly expanding in depth and width as they
advanced.</p>
<p>They had now passed the last great bend in this majestic
river, and had almost a due westerly course before them until
they should reach the Pacific. Off to the north-east they
could see the massive snow-covered peak of St. Helen&rsquo;s, as it
towered aloft for fully thirteen thousand feet. Shortly after
they glided by the mouth of a considerable stream that put
in from the north.</p>
<p>Just as the twilight descended upon wood and stream the
canoe reached Astoria, and this portion of their journey was
finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />THE SEA TRAIL.</h2>
<p>Although, as we have said, the day was drawing to a close
when our friends landed in Astoria, they lost no time in
making search for Little Rifle and her father, directing their
steps, naturally enough, to the old tavern which stands back
some distance from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thar they ar&rsquo; now!</i>&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Old Robsart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? where?&rdquo; asked Harry, starting and looking
about in great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar! don&rsquo;t you see &rsquo;em? I mean them two red-skins
that fotched &rsquo;em here! They&rsquo;re Blackfeet, both of &rsquo;em;
they&rsquo;re the very varmints we&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he pointed out two Indians seated upon the
ground, with a bottle of whisky between them. Sure
enough they were the very men that had brought down Ravenna
and his daughter from the Blackfoot village. Having
been well paid for their work they had purchased a few
gaudy ornaments at the fort, and were now fast drinking
themselves dead drunk upon the red-man&rsquo;s great enemy,
&ldquo;fire-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they were so far gone now, that there was very
little to be got out of them, and Old Ruff would have
succeeded no better than he did with the sailors up the river,
had he not snatched their whisky-bottle away from them,
and sworn that they should not have it again, until they answered
him every question.</p>
<p>After a half-hour&rsquo;s hard work, he learned that they had
reached Astoria on the preceding day with their charge, that
they had seen them sail away in a &ldquo;much big canoe&rdquo; toward
the great lake, as they supposed, on a trip to some happy
hunting-ground.</p>
<p>At the tavern or inn, more definite information was gained.
They learned that Mr. Ravenna had arrived there in a ship
from San Francisco, several weeks before, and remaining only
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
a day, had hired a couple of hunters to take him up the river
to meet some Indian chief. On the preceding day he had
returned, in a canoe under the charge of the two Blackfeet,
and having with him, what seemed a boy, attired in Indian
dress. He was very quiet, had scarcely anything to say, and
very little was seen of him.</p>
<p>They had taken passage on this same morning for San
Francisco, in the same vessel that had brought the father
there, and by this time were fairly out to sea, on their way
thither.</p>
<p>This was to the point, as were the query and answer as to
when another boat left the port for the same destination.
The captain of the schooner Albatross was sitting in the bar-room
at the time, and replied that he should weigh anchor at
sunrise on the morrow, when the tide would be in and the
bar could be passed without trouble.</p>
<p>Could he take a couple of passengers who would pay him
well for the accommodation?</p>
<p>Certainly; any thing in the way of business, and to please
the gentlemen.</p>
<p>But just here, the trapper called Harry aside and conveyed
the unexpected startling information that he had decided to
go no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he said, by way of explanation. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t be of no further help to you; all you&rsquo;ve got to do, is
to go on board the Albatross, and squat down and wait till
she lands you in Fr&rsquo;isco. When you git there you kin hunt
out the little gal as well without as you kin with me. I
must look after them furs and peltries of mine, and when I
go back I&rsquo;ll stop at Fort Abercombie, and tell your old man
that you&rsquo;re all right, and you know that&rsquo;ll be a great satisfaction
to him. You&rsquo;re on the right track now, and thar ain&rsquo;t
no Blackfeet in the way to make any bother. You&rsquo;ve got
plain sailin&rsquo;, and like &rsquo;nough you&rsquo;ll git into Fr&rsquo;isco as soon
as the other boat does. Leastways you&rsquo;ll have no trouble
to find the little critter, and when you do, give her my love,
and tell her I&rsquo;ll be down that way purty soon, to see her,
or I&rsquo;ll foller her wherever she goes. Don&rsquo;t you see, younker,
that that&rsquo;s the true plan and the best one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could not help seeing the force of what the trapper
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
said, and he admitted it; but as he had not the least thought
of such a proceeding upon his part, it required some time for
him to feel perfectly resigned to it.</p>
<p>The agreement was made that Old Ruff should remain
over night with Harry at the inn and then start on his return
to the beaver runs beyond the Cascade Range, while he
should move down the coast toward San Francisco.</p>
<p>And with this understanding the parties retired at a late
hour.</p>
<p>The arrangement was carried out almost to the letter, as
the trapper left the inn at an early hour, bidding Harry an
affectionate farewell, with the confident hope that they would
soon meet again.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when the Albatross crossed the bar at
the mouth of the river, ten miles further down, and placed
herself fairly on the Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>As soon as the sloop was fairly out to sea, and sailing
northward, Harry gave himself up to the enjoyment of the
scene. Walking to the prow, he took a station where he
was not likely to be in the way and feasted upon the view,
which was a novel and deeply interesting one to him.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />THE WIND THAT BLEW NO GOOD.</h2>
<p>When Harry Northend finally aroused himself from the
fanciful dreams into which he had fallen, the sun had gone
down, and it was already growing dark. He noticed that the
sea was heavier than usual, and the ship tossed and pitched
in a way that was any thing but pleasant to a landsman.</p>
<p>He had a dread of being sea-sick, but it may be that there
was something in the rough out-door life that he had been
leading during the past few months that acted as a preventive;
for now, when the real test had come, in the tossing
and heaving of the sea, he was not sensible of the slightest
disturbance, and, as he descended into the cabin to take his
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
supper with the captain, that functionary took occasion to
congratulate him upon his good fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may get sick yet,&rdquo; timidly returned the boy,
&ldquo;as we are only fairly started on our trip, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will,&rdquo; was the hearty reply of the captain,
as he helped himself to a huge slice of fried pork, &ldquo;though
a chap, if he is going to have it, is pretty sure to show signs
of it by this time. However, we are going to have rough
weather before we get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the bronzed and bearded face with
some apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that a storm is brewing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly; I can always feel it in that larboard leg of
mine&mdash;a touch of the rheumatics, you know&mdash;a reg&rsquo;lar barometer&mdash;sure
to tell me when trouble is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a coast have we here?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the infernalest coasts in the whole creation,&rdquo;
was the reply of Captain Cole. &ldquo;I was wrecked on it twice,
and the last time I came up, only missed it by a hair&rsquo;s
breadth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could not but feel alarmed at the words of the captain;
but beyond his own personal fear, was anxiety about
Little Rifle, who, he knew, was at no great distance ahead,
and whose vessel would be caught in the same tempest, if it
should come, and would, in all human probability, share the
same fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what boat Mr. Ravenna and his daughter
sailed upon?&rdquo; he asked of the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the prompt answer. &ldquo;It was the North
Star, a schooner belonging to the Smith Brothers, of Fr&rsquo;isco,
engaged in the same trade with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she a stanch vessel, able to weather such a storm as
seems to be coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is one of the rottenest, good-for-nothingest old hulks
in the trade. It&rsquo;s a wonder to me that she hasn&rsquo;t gone to the
bottom before, for she ain&rsquo;t any better than an old tub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was very dispiriting tidings, to say the least, and
Harry began to believe that instead of being through with the
difficulties and dangers, the greatest still remained before
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>As if to emphasize the words of the captain, the whistling
of the wind through the cordage at this moment rose so high
and shrill, that they distinctly heard it in the cabin, although
the door was closed. At the same time the vessel made a
deep plunge into the sea.</p>
<p>Captain Cole shook his head in a knowing way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tell you it&rsquo;s coming, sure; you can make up your
mind to that. I tell you that a <i>howler</i> is coming up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain arose and went on deck, and Harry followed
him, that he might see for himself the prospect before them.</p>
<p>The change that he encountered was enough to make the
strongest man, unaccustomed to the sea, draw back in terror.</p>
<p>It was of pitchy darkness, and the gale, as it whistled
through the rigging, rose and swelled like the shrieking of
spirits in the air, as they floated high above the mast, or glided
over the deck; the wind that blew against his cheeks brought
with it the brine of the ocean, and he instinctively clapped
his hand upon his head to prevent his hat being carried
away.</p>
<p>The sloop was pitching and tossing quite heavily, but still
she held her own. All sail was crowded on, and she seemed
to be under capital control, if it would only last.</p>
<p>The captain speedily vanished in the gloom, as he went to
take his place at the helm, and relieve the mate, who had been
stationed there during his absence.</p>
<p>When Harry found himself out of the cabin and upon the
deck, he staggered to the gunwale, where he caught hold with
both hands and held on, while he listened and looked, and
endeavored to gain a fair view of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a strong gale of wind,&rdquo; he thought, as the spray
went dashing over his head; &ldquo;but I can not see why there
should be any great danger. She has not taken in any sail
yet, and so long as the wind keeps as it is, it will only hurry
us on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking aloft, not a star was to be seen. The sky seemed
to be wrapped in the densest, blackest gloom.</p>
<p>Looking off to the southward, Harry fancied, once or twice,
that he detected a bright point of light appear through the
night.</p>
<p>Only for an instant was it visible, when it vanished again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and he supposed it was produced by the phosphorescence of
the sea, until he happened to be gazing directly toward the
point where it appeared, when it struck him that its appearance
was different from that. It was more like the glimmering
of a star, that is shut out at intervals by some dark body
coming between it and the observer, to re&auml;ppear again in a
few moments.</p>
<p>While Harry was puzzling his brains over the singular appearance
of this light, somebody slapped him upon the shoulder,
causing him to turn with a suddenness that almost threw
him off his feet.</p>
<p>In the murky gloom, he was barely able to make out a human
figure, which he suspected was that of the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my boy, you had better go below!&rdquo; he called out,
in a cheery voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me what that light means?&rdquo; Harry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? I don&rsquo;t see any,&rdquo; replied the officer, halting by
his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gone now&mdash;there it is again. Look! it seems like a
star!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that! Why that&rsquo;s the binnacle light of another boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what one it is?&rdquo; asked the lad, with a vague
but terrible misgiving freezing his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly enough light to read her name; wait until morning,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you what she is, and where she hails from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry was about to ask more, but the captain moved away
in the darkness, leaving him alone.</p>
<p>He remained on deck, watching the fitful twinkling of the
point of light, as it rose to view on the crest of a wave, and
then dipped out of sight again, and speculating as to what the
night and following day would bring forth.</p>
<p>But, as the night advanced, he thought there was very little
if any increase in the fury of the gale, and he descended
into the cabin, where Captain Cole had placed a hammock at
his disposal.</p>
<p>Here he committed his soul in fervent prayer to God, and
then lay down without removing any of his garments; for he
had no expectation of sleep, and had little hope that he would
be permitted to remain undisturbed until the rising of the
morrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />WHAT OF THE NIGHT?</h2>
<p>Harry Northend had been through many perils and trying
scenes in the wilderness of the North-west; but just now
he felt more wretched from physical fear than ever before.</p>
<p>It was useless for him to lie upon his hammock, and he
only did so because he had nothing else to do. Finally he
leaped down upon the floor, and taking a seat upon the bench,
concluded to sit out the night.</p>
<p>The lantern swinging from the roof threw a dim, yellow
glare through the cabin, and, as he mechanically looked up,
he saw a half-dozen life-preservers dangling beside it. They
were made of cork, and were the same as he had often seen
upon the Mississippi steamers.</p>
<p>Unfastening one of the useful articles, he carefully fastened
it beneath his shoulders, and then resuming his seat, waited
as the terrible moments dragged slowly by.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting with bowed head, his thoughts upon his
mother and home, when he was again brought to his feet by
another outburst. This time it was the heavy boom of thunder,
that appeared to burst overhead, scarcely higher than the
masts, and which made the sloop tremble as if struck by a
mountainous surge.</p>
<p>This was the first time since starting that he had heard the
noise of thunder, and somehow or other, whether with or
without reason, we can not say, he had mainly founded his
hope upon that fact, persuading himself that so long as that
was absent, there was good reason for believing the vessel
would safely ride out the gale.</p>
<p>The boat was still shivering beneath the shock, when there
came another rattling, reverberating peal, ten times louder
than before, and that paralyzed Harry for the moment with
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vessel has been struck!&rdquo; he gasped, as soon as he recovered
his self-possession, and then staggering to the door,
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
he drew it open, and looked out, expecting to see the boat
hissing in flames.</p>
<p>But no; it was still unharmed; but the dense blackness
was cut in a hundred places by the zigzag lightning, that was
flaming from every portion of the heavens, and seemed to be
playing about the vessel preparatory to splitting it into a
thousand fragments.</p>
<p>Harry partially ascended from the cabin, and then paused
transfixed by the terrible scene. It was now raining, the
drops of water being carried along almost horizontally by the
hurricane, and striking his face like particles of sand. By
the intense brightness of the lightning, he could catch sight
of the towering billows that rushed tumultuously toward the
doomed vessel, each one, as if it were about to overwhelm it,
their tops white with foam, while their concave walls appeared,
as momentarily seen, as if they were of ink.</p>
<p>The wind shrieked and moaned through the cordage, and
the captain&rsquo;s orders, as he shouted them through his speaking-trumpet,
sounded as if they came from some point miles
away. By the same vivid flashes, he caught sight of him
and the seamen, standing like statues, cool, self-possessed, and
ready for whatever the elements should bring them.</p>
<p>Harry was recalled to a more vivid sense of his perilous
position by a tremendous surge, which striking the side of the
vessel with all its force, instead of dashing itself into spray
and mist, broke so as to send an immense volume bodily
across the decks, precipitating itself against him with such
violence that he was thrown senseless to the floor of the cabin.</p>
<p>He had an indistinct recollection of hearing the door
slammed to at the same instant, and concluded, when he recovered
his senses, that it had been done by one of the seamen,
as a reminder for him to keep it closed, so as to prevent
the water from entering, the hatches having long since been
fastened down.</p>
<p>The lad did not remain unconscious for any length of
time. The sense of impending danger was too vivid and intense,
and the shuddering and tossing of the vessel too constant
for him to continue insensible to it. Recovering his
feet he again sat down, holding on tightly to prevent himself
being tossed upon his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>And sitting there he could hear the mighty waves sweep
over the deck with a fierce impetuosity that it seemed must
rend the vessel asunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer, oh heaven! can this tortured vessel
stand this?&rdquo; he exclaimed, more than once, as it labored up
from the trough of the sea.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />WAITING FOR THE END.</h2>
<p>The terrible night wore slowly away. If the sloop Albatross
was unseaworthy she still struggled manfully and
bravely with the furious tempest. It seemed at times as if
human ingenuity could not put timbers together strong
enough to withstand the avalanche-like pounding of the
mountain surges; but still she labored on, panting and
plunging through the waves that broke and swept her decks
from end to end.</p>
<p>It was near daylight, and Harry was sitting in the manner
mentioned, when he observed that the floor of the cabin was
covered with water. Of course a considerable quantity had
been dashed in with him at the time he was struck by the
wave and precipitated to the bottom, but it appeared that this
quantity was increasing.</p>
<p>The constant pitching and tossing made it impossible for
him to measure the hight by any mark upon the side of the
cabin, but a few minutes&rsquo; careful survey convinced him that
he was not mistaken.</p>
<p>Just then the dull thumping of one of the pumps reached
his ears, and he understood that the vessel was leaking.</p>
<p>His little knowledge of a vessel had led him to suppose
that in case they sprung a leak the last place into which the
water made its way was the cabin; but he could well understand
how in such a gale as this such furious wrenching must
open the seams in a score of places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is leaking&mdash;that&rsquo;s certain!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the
sousing and dashing of the water made his position anything
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
but a pleasant one. &ldquo;I believe it will gain upon them too, if
the storm continues much longer, so that the hold will fill
with water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely any change was to be noticed in the thunder-claps,
which continually sounded in the ear with a stunning
uproar to which Harry was in a certain respect indifferent. It
was not the lightning which he feared, but the sea, the tempest;
it was the shivering ship, the crashing billows, whose
frightful perils he could not drive from his mind if he desired,
which at any moment might consign him to the merciless
ocean.</p>
<p>Finally he concluded to make the attempt to reach the
deck again, for he was convinced from the way that the boat
was laboring, and the increasing water in the cabin, that she
was sinking, and he judged that Captain Cole was too much
occupied to leave his post, and perhaps when the critical
moment came would forget him altogether and leave him
to his fate.</p>
<p>At the very moment he placed his hand upon the door it
was shoved violently inward, and the stentorian voice of
Captain Cole shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my boy, time&rsquo;s up; are you ready to go to Davy
Jones&rsquo; locker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frightful scene met his gaze as he came upon deck.
The night was passed, but the morning that had succeeded
was scarcely less terrible.</p>
<p>The wind, which had been blowing a hurricane, had
abated somewhat, but a rain, mixed with snow, swept horizontally
through the air, with a cutting chilliness; the billows
came sweeping tumultuously forward, so close after
each other that they looked like the snowy ridges of countless
mountains; the hold of the vessel was half full of water,
and she plunged and struggled like some dying monster.</p>
<p>No sunlight lit up the dreadful scene, but a gray, horrid
mist shut out all sight for a distance of a hundred yards;
the seamen seeing that all further effort was useless had
lashed themselves to the rigging, but the stern Captain Cole
disdained all such assistance, and managed by herculean
strength and skill to keep himself from being washed overboard
by the waves that broke ceaselessly over the deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Harry saw it was sure death to venture away, and he
crouched down by the cabin, so as to permit it partly to
shield him from the fearful avalanches of water.</p>
<p>The minutes seemed of eternal length, but he had been
here only a few seconds when he became aware of a dull,
booming roar that rose above the tumult of the tempest.
The captain, maintaining a position near him, seemed to
divine his thoughts, and stooping down so as to bring his
mouth close to his ear, shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the breakers you hear! We shall strike in a few
minutes! Hang on till the hulk goes to pieces, and then do
what you can to reach shore. Can you swim?&rdquo; he asked,
noticing the life-preserver.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, for it was useless for him to attempt to
speak in this pandemonium of sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help each other,&rdquo; shouted back the strong-lunged
Captain Cole; &ldquo;if I can, I&rsquo;ll do all that&rsquo;s possible for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Albatross was drifting rapidly toward shore, for at this
moment the bold, rocky headland of the California coast
loomed up to view, with the churning breakers at their base,
curling and foaming in their restless fury.</p>
<p>The rocks looked black, dripping and unutterably cheerless
in the misty morning; but the yearning eyes that peered
through the fog could see also the sand of the beach at their
feet, showing standing-room for any who might be fortunate
enough to be cast thither.</p>
<p>But, behold! As Harry looked he saw the dark hull of
another vessel pounding against the shore. It had struck some
time before, and while the bow remained immovably fixed, the
stern was rearing and plunging in a way which showed that
it must speedily go to pieces. Not even an iron-clad could
withstand such blows as it was receiving each moment.</p>
<p>Harry Northend forgot his own peril in his interest in the
scene. He could discern several figures clinging to the bow,
and one of them as dimly revealed through the blinding mist
and sleet, he was sure was Little Rifle, while the tall, dark
form near her must be that of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the North Star!&rdquo; screeched Captain Cole, who well
understood the anxiety of the lad; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to strike
pretty near her. Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>This exclamation was caused by a sudden thumping jar,
followed by another plunge and then a fearful shock, that
threw the captain forward upon his face, causing him to roll
heavily against the gunwale, which he clutched, barely in
time to save himself from going overboard.</p>
<p>Every blow of the waves only drove the prow the more
firmly into the sand, while the stern, still in deep water,
worked heavily around, until that, too, remained fast, and the
Albatross thus lay broadside on, exposed to the full fury of
the tempest; but a moment later, from some unexplained
cause, the bow was lifted, and by a strange action of the
waves, swung around, so that it pointed directly out to sea,
and the rudder was the part nearest shore.</p>
<p>This rendered the stern the safest part, especially as the
bow began working down in the sand, and it became necessary
for Harry to shift his position. The seamen, by ascending
some distance up the rigging and lashing themselves fast,
had placed themselves above the reach of the waves, and Captain
Cole, feeling that nothing else remained, prepared to do
the same with Harry.</p>
<p>Watching his chance, he dashed forward, and catching the
hand of the boy, had him at the foot of the ladder in a twinkling.
Here another surge caught them, and but for the help
of the officer, the boy would have been shot out on the crest
of one of the billows, like an egg-shell.</p>
<p>But he knew what was required of him, and he went up
the ladder as nimbly as a monkey, the captain at his heels,
neither pausing until they reached a safe point, where they
could maintain themselves with comparatively little difficulty
for some time.</p>
<p>The trouble was, that if compelled to remain here very
long, the driving sleet would so benumb their limbs that they
would become unable to maintain their hold. The seamen,
although strong and rugged men, had been on deck for twelve
hours, and needed to be lashed to make sure of their footing.</p>
<p>But every probability was that not a soul would be left on
board at the end of an hour, and this precaution was unnecessary
in the case of the two who had last ascended.</p>
<p>It was not until Harry had been perched here for several
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
minutes that he was able to take a survey of his surroundings.</p>
<p>As the chief officer had predicted, they had struck the beach
very near the other vessel&mdash;less than a hundred feet separated
them&mdash;and, as the lad looked off in that direction, he saw
among the three figures clustered at the bow that of Little
Rifle.</p>
<p>Most of the crew of the North Star had also lashed themselves
to the rigging, but the bow being much more sheltered
than was that of the Albatross, the three persons mentioned
were enabled to maintain themselves with little exertion.</p>
<p>The tall dark figure, which Harry supposed to be the father,
had placed himself in such a position as to shut off most
of the fury of the tempest from his loved daughter.</p>
<p>And Little Rifle, holding on like a heroine, as she was,
looked off in the rigging of the other ship, and saw Harry
Northend, who was also gazing toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she recognize me?&rdquo; was the thought in the mind of
the lad, as he gazed wistfully at her.</p>
<p>His heart warmed with delight, even at this awful time,
when the next moment he saw her raise her hand and wave
it toward him. Regardless of his own danger, he returned
the salutation, and shouted back, but the sound scarcely
reached the ears of the captain, directly below him.</p>
<p>In that moment what must have been the thoughts of Little
Rifle?</p>
<p>She could but have known what the presence of Harry
Northend meant at this time. That one glance must have
told the story of his patient, loving following of her through
forest and mountain, and over river and sea, until finally they
were brought face to face again in the midst of the tempestuous
fury of the Pacific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! what would I not give for the privilege of exchanging
one single word with her?&rdquo; thought Harry, as he remained
gazing steadfastly across the short but impassable
chasm. &ldquo;I wonder which of us will have to go first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon shall the question be answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />THE LEAP FOR LIFE.</h2>
<p>All this time the eye of Captain Cole was scanning the
coast before them, and he was coolly weighing the chances it
offered for an escape for him and his companions.</p>
<p>He noticed that the high, precipitous bluffs, as we have
already mentioned, directly opposite them, sat back some distance
from the shore. Were it otherwise, not the slightest
hope would remain for the most daring swimmer that ever
cleft the wave.</p>
<p>Not a living soul was to be seen upon these bluffs. He
knew that further inland were marauding Indians, who, if
they knew of the booty that was thus offered, would swarm
along the shore in myriads, eager and impatient for the sea
to cast the prey into their hands.</p>
<p>If they should appear, one would have little to choose
between going down in the sea at rest, or in being washed
ashore in the full possession of life and strength.</p>
<p>Harry had withdrawn his attention for the moment from
the other vessel, when he felt the captain touch his leg, and,
as he looked down at him to see what it meant, he pointed
to the wreck.</p>
<p>One glance showed that it was breaking up. Large fragments
could be seen tossed aloft by the waves, and to several
of them, men were clinging.</p>
<p>Only two remained upon the prow and they were Little
Rifle and her father. The other had also plunged into the
boiling sea, in his desperate struggle for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they wait?&rdquo; was the question that came involuntarily
to the lips of the terrified lad; &ldquo;they may as well take
the leap first as last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had considerable hope of their escaping. He knew
that Little Rifle was a perfect swimmer, and he had heard
old Ruff Robsart tell of some of her wonderful exploits in
water. It was to be supposed, of course, that her father was
also an expert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Instead of watching those upon the wreck, Captain Cole
was carefully observing those who were in the water; for the
probability was that whatever fate befell them would befall
those who came after. If they escaped, so might he; if they
failed, the probabilities were that he would.</p>
<p>He saw them carried swiftly southward, all passing close
to his own boat, and one poor fellow was swept under the
bow, bruised and drowned; but the three others, clinging to
the fragments cleared the second wreck, and by a curious
action of the eddying current, were whirled in so close to
shore, that by tremendous and powerful swimming all three
reached land and were seen to wade up the beach, dripping
with brine, and scarcely able to stand.</p>
<p>This was encouraging, for the captain would not acknowledge
that his superior in swimming had yet been born. It
was characteristic of the man, that disclaiming all assistance
in the shape of life-preservers or pieces of the wreck, he
should fling himself boldly into the ocean and begin the
struggle single-handed.</p>
<p>The eyes of Harry Northend were naturally fixed upon
him, and he watched his movements with an intensity of interest
that can scarcely be imagined. He observed that as he
drifted southward, he aimed directly for the shore, swimming
with a steady and powerful stroke. He made no attempt to
prevent the foam of the breakers from going over his head;
for the simple reason that he knew no mortal man can support
himself in spray and foam. All that he can do, is to
hold his breath, and wait for a chance to get another mouthful
of air.</p>
<p>This the sailor did, surely and steadily approaching the
shore, until as tossed high upon the crest of a mighty wave,
he made land, and clinging to the sand, scrambled up out of
the baffled waves.</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes were upon the brave captain, and his heart
gave a throb of pleasure as he saw that one at least had
escaped, when something dark caught his eye in the water,
and he saw that Little Rifle was in the water, clinging to a
fragment of the wreck, and using might and main to reach
the shore.</p>
<p>One glance at where the other wreck had been, showed that
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
it was gone. The sea was sweeping over the spot, and the
only part that remained visible was that to which the two
were holding fast, and this was spinning resistlessly in the
current.</p>
<p>Harry would have saluted them by way of encouragement,
as they passed, but they were too much engaged with their
own work to glance right or left.</p>
<p>The lad wondered why it was that Little Rifle persisted in
clinging to the plank, when her ability in swimming would
enable her to make much better progress toward the shore;
but, as he watched the movements of the two, he rightly suspected
that she did this to assist her father, who was not her
equal in swimming, and who was afraid to trust himself alone
in the waves.</p>
<p>The progress upon a raft is necessarily much slower than
that of simply relying upon one&rsquo;s muscular power and skill
in the water; and so, with a terrible misgiving, he saw the
two sweep on down the coast, without, so far as he was able
to judge, coming any nearer.</p>
<p>It was plain that the exertions of the noble-hearted girl
were intended mainly to benefit her parent. If she should
fling herself loose from the float, and strike out for the shore,
she could reach it as certainly as did Captain Cole, and the
seamen of her own vessel.</p>
<p>As if to convince her of the truth of this, the sailors who
had been lashed in the rigging of the Albatross, were now
struggling in the water and steadily making their way to
shore.</p>
<p>But certain death itself would not have dissuaded her from
the attempt. With all her bravery and remarkable skill, she
worked the craft toward the land, determined that if saved
or lost, it should be in the company of her parent.</p>
<p>Harry felt that the time had come for him to make the
&ldquo;leap for life&rdquo;; for he was the only one left, and the wreck
itself gave signs of breaking up; but before doing so, he was
anxious to see what became of Little Rifle; for if she
escaped, he would be nerved to make greater exertions for
his own safety.</p>
<p>Harry took a look at the father and daughter, but it was
not a very satisfactory one, and convinced that it would not
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
do for him to remain longer, he came carefully down the
ladder, so as to leap into the sea in such a way as to run no
danger of being swept under or against the hull.</p>
<p>He was nearly to the bottom, when there was a fearful
swaying, and he saw that the wreck was turning upon its side.</p>
<p>Not a moment was to be lost, and with a prayer upon his
lip, he leaped as far out in the boiling waves as was possible,
and like Captain Cole, struck straight for shore, with all the
strength at his command, dreading each moment to receive a
crushing blow from the mast or one of the spars.</p>
<p>He escaped this, but he found it almost impossible to prevent
himself from strangling, as he seemed to be under water
nearly all the time.</p>
<p>But he struggled bravely as long as power remained. He
could see the black rocks gleaming wet and cheerless near
him; dim figures of men upon the beach&mdash;something like a
shout&mdash;then all was blackness of darkness&mdash;and he knew
nothing.</p>
<p>Was this death?</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br />CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>As Harry Northend found himself battling with the billows,
he struggled manfully and heroically; for like every young,
hopeful boy, he had everything to live for. His life preserver
kept him from sinking, but it could not prevent the crests
from curling over his head, and in this way, when he was
comparatively a short distance from shore, he became bewildered,
confused and strangled, and lost consciousness at the
moment when only a few sturdy strokes were needed to
carry him safely to land.</p>
<p>But here were a number who were watching his movements
ready to give what assistance they could, the moment
they could gain the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>Little Rifle and her father succeeded in reaching land,
without difficulty, and she was little exhausted. The moment
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
she felt the solid land beneath her, she turned about to see
what had become of her friend Harry Northend. For one
moment, she thought he was gone, but the next instant he
rose to view on the crest of a wave, and she saw that he
was struggling for life.</p>
<p>As he was drifting down the coast, the eight or ten persons
on the beach hurried down, so as to keep opposite, and
to be ready to lend a hand the moment it could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we had a rope!&rdquo; exclaimed Little Rifle, as she saw
how vainly her lover was struggling, &ldquo;we might save
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we hain&rsquo;t got a rope,&rdquo; growled Captain Cole, &ldquo;so
what&rsquo;s the use? But we can form a line ourselves, and
maybe get out to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was no sooner mentioned than it was done, all taking
hold of hands, and while those composing one end of the
line stood on the shore, the others waded out as far as was
prudent, the whole line running backward when it was
deemed prudent, or those furthest out to sea did their best to
&ldquo;ride&rdquo; the billows, as they came rolling in.</p>
<p>Captain Cole intended to take the outer end or post of
danger himself, but seeing the anxiety of Little Rifle, and
noticing her excellence as a swimmer, he permitted her to go
out, while he griped her small hand in his horny palm, with
a power that would have pulled the arm from the socket before
it would have permitted it to be withdrawn from his
grasp.</p>
<p>It was well that the captain retained his hold upon the
hand or wrist of Little Rifle; for her anxiety to get out to
the assistance of the despairing Harry Northend was so great,
that she would have plunged directly among the waves, careless
of her own fate, in her desire to save him.</p>
<p>But the sailor would not permit any such vicarious sacrifice
as that, struggle as much as she might. Three separate
times Little Rifle attempted to catch the coat of the boy, as
he went up the billow; but he was too weak to help himself,
and she just missed him each time.</p>
<p>Again a giant wave carried him aloft, and, as Captain Cole
gave her more room, she threw herself into it also, with the
resolve to secure him this time, no matter at what cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>A desperate clutch, as far out as the iron grip of the sailor
would permit, and her hand grasped the sleeve of the boy.
She had caught him at last.</p>
<p>The captain saw it, and giving the signal, the rest of the
line ran up the beach, the half-dozen who were furthest out,
tumbling pell mell over each other, as the wave broke and
carried them up the sand.</p>
<p>As soon as she felt that they were safe against being carried
back by the undertow, Little Rifle knelt over the form
of Harry, and raising his head upon her knee, looked longingly
down on his face to see whether life had departed or
not. It was hard for her to tell, but while gazing, the bluff
Captain Cole stooped over her shoulder and put his hand
upon his forehead and then upon his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;considerably bruised and
half-choked, but don&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s breathing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, then, he will not die?&rdquo; she said, just raising
her voice loud enough to be heard in the tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worth ten thousand dead boys; he&rsquo;ll come around
all right in a few minutes; but we must get up a fire some
way or other or we shall all perish. Dobbins must have got
a crack on his head, some way or other, for he&rsquo;s dead as a
door-nail. Well, you watch him while I see what can be
done about starting a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By dint of great effort, sufficient fuel was gathered, and a
strong fire was kindled, around which the miserable shipwrecked
sufferers gathered, and managed to keep themselves
from perishing.</p>
<p>No Indians were to be seen, and, as the high cliffs shut out
the view inland, they had strong hopes of escaping this danger.</p>
<p>It was found that two of the seamen had suffered such injuries,
that, in spite of all that could be done, they succumbed
and died. Wet, cold and hungry, the others could not have
been much more miserable than they already were.</p>
<p>The storm rapidly abated, the sun coming out toward noon,
and, as they caught sight of a sail in the distance, every thing
was done to attract their notice. Captain Cole and a couple
of his sailors ascended the cliffs and displayed signals of distress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Fortunately these attempts succeeded, and about the middle
of the afternoon, the ship came in as close to shore as was
prudent, and a boat was sent in to bring the shipwrecked
crew and passengers off.</p>
<p>The sea was still running very high, but by good seamanship,
the task was accomplished without any mishap. The
two dead bodies were also brought off, and given a burial
from the ship.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>On the clear, starry night that succeeded the tempestuous
one, Harry Northend and Hagar Ravenna, better known as
Little Rifle, sat by themselves, conversing over the past and
speculating as to the future.</p>
<p>Her hand was imprisoned in his, and she no longer attempted
to conceal the love that warmed her heart.</p>
<p>They first conversed of the past, and she made her story
full and complete.</p>
<p>On that night when the two encamped in the Oregon wilderness,
she had not the remotest intention of leaving him in
the manner that she did.</p>
<p>But while he slept, the revelation that had been made to
her during the preceding few hours drove all slumber from
her eyelids. It so wrought upon her finally that she was
obliged to rise to her feet, and pace back and forth in the
gloom, as a man will do when crushed by some overwhelming
calamity.</p>
<p>And then, fearful of awakening him, she wandered away
in the gloom, expecting to return when she was able to master
her emotions.</p>
<p>She wept and cried, and was almost beside herself, until
she flung herself upon the ground, and prayed God to prevent
her reason deserting her.</p>
<p>While lying thus in the gloom of the forest, she felt the
distinct shock of an earthquake, and springing to her feet,
was sensible of the ground swaying beneath. This new terror
caused her to fall senseless to the ground.</p>
<p>When she regained her consciousness she was in a canoe,
speeding swiftly down-stream, and in the dim light of the
early dawn, she recognized the chief Maquesa, who, in answer
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
to her questions, told her that he was taking her to her father.</p>
<p>All that he said corresponded with what she had learned
the previous day, and sad as she felt at the manner that she
had left her dear friend, she could not refuse to go with him.</p>
<p>She gave the particulars of their journey through the
woods and mountains, saying that never until she caught sight
of Harry upon the wrecked Albatross did she know of a certainty
that he was pursuing her.</p>
<p>It was plain now that when Robsart referred to the manner
of her departure, he was convinced that she had temporarily
lost her reason&mdash;but he forbore saying so, through fear
of needlessly distressing her.</p>
<p>The meeting between father and daughter was singular and
pathetic, and it was a sad, strange story that he told.</p>
<p>Jared Ravenna was one of the early pioneers of California,
and in the year 1846 visited Astoria, where he met Maquesa,
the Blackfoot chief, one day while hunting. A curious concurrence
of circumstances caused a strong friendship to spring
up between the two. He roamed the woods for weeks and
months with him, and might have remained for years; but
the discovery of gold in California, caused him, with hundreds
of others, to hurry thither.</p>
<p>Good fortune attended him in the mines, and leaving there
he went east, married the love of his youth, and returned
again to California; but the rugged life he was compelled to
lead was too much for his wife, who died at the birth of Hagar.</p>
<p>California at that time was infested with the scum of the
earth, and not knowing what to do with the infant, he thought
of his old friend Maquesa, and sailing to Astoria, placed her
in charge of the chief, who agreed to give her the best care
until she should reach a suitable age to be taken on the long
journey eastward, to receive proper attention and education.</p>
<p>A whim led the father to purchase the little rifle of a
miner, and to leave that with her, to provide against a contingency
which he hoped would never occur.</p>
<p>It was the intention of Mr. Ravenna to return and claim
his child at the end of two years, he agreeing to pay the
chief a handsome sum for the care she was to receive in the
interval at the hands of his squaw, himself and people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Only moderate fortune attending Mr. Ravenna&rsquo;s second
venture in the mines, he entered into a speculation somewhat
of a different and somewhat of the same character. Receiving
what they deemed reliable information of the existence
of gold on an almost unknown portion of the African
coast, a party was formed to go thither.</p>
<p>When near their destination their vessel was wrecked, and
those of their company who were not lost fell into the hands
of the savages. A half dozen were kept in confinement for
nearly ten years, when three of them succeeded one dark
night in swimming off to a slaver, and by a roundabout and
wearisome route the despairing father at last found his way
back to California, where to his amazement he discovered
himself wealthy from the appreciation of a large quantity
of land to which he possessed a clear title.</p>
<p>But he cared nothing for this. His child was his whole
thought, and without an hour&rsquo;s unnecessary delay he reached
Astoria, where he found not a soul recognized him, so great
had been the personal change in his appearance during his
long years of absence.</p>
<p>With the assistance of a couple of Indians he had little
difficulty in reaching Maquesa, who had long since given him
up as dead. The chief undoubtedly suspected the identity of
Little Rifle, but cared not to interfere between her and Old
Ruff Robsart, so long as he believed her parent would not
return to claim her.</p>
<p>So much of the Past.</p>
<p>And now of the Present.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenna was devotedly attached to his child, who was
rapidly learning to return his love. During his absence San
Francisco had become a great and growing city, and he proposed
to settle down there and devote himself to the education
and welfare of his daughter. He received Harry as his
own child, and made him promise to make his home with
him until his own father should come to claim him.</p>
<p>And the future, who should penetrate that?</p>
<p>A couple of months later Mr. Northend appeared in San
Francisco, in company with Old Ruff Robsart, who was almost
as wild with delight to meet his own Little Rifle again as she
was to see him. He already noted a rapid improvement in
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
her manner and appearance, and he was sure she was going
to make the handsomest woman that ever lived. He said,
in course of their many conversations, that one reason he returned
to the wilds of Oregon was to visit the cavern, in
which it will be remembered Harry and Little Rifle had become
lost, after the former had gone over the falls. He expected
to find gold there, and so he did, but in too insignificant
quantities to compensate him, and so he left in disgust.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Five years later, the prosperous merchant, Harry Northend,
received his Bride of the Wilderness, as he still fondly termed
her, and wishing them all happiness we bid them farewell.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
